730310,DYNASTY WARRIORS 9,"Feb 13, 2018",44.99,"Experience the thrill of one versus thousands in an all new open world setting with DYNASTY WARRIORS 9, the latest installment in the series! ・A New Open World Warriors Game For the first time in the series, the expansive land of China is shown on a single map with the introduction of an open world format for diverse progression through the game. The 'one vs. thousands' exhilarating action of the Warriors series and the beloved characters from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms tale are carried over, but the freedom through an open world stage provides a brand new Warriors experience. Key Missions unfold and progress the story of the player character, and are supplemented by numerous missions from various regions such as Regular Missions that affect the Key Missions and requests from other characters. The situation will be ever changing depending on what missions are selected. In the many battles that occur on the map, players will find a variety of strategies and tactics open to them such as 'attacking head on,' 'launching a surprise attack from an elevated position' or 'infiltrating at night', for numerous ways to enjoy the expansive world of the Three Kingdoms. The map is displayed with beautiful graphics and features many different regions of China such as snow plains, jungles and deserts which reflect the passage of time and changing climate. Key cities and checkpoints, such as Luoyang and Hulao Gate, and landmarks such as the Yellow River and Mt. Song, are replicated, allowing for deeper immersion into the game world. ・A Redefined Action System The new State Combo System reacts and responds to the surrounding conditions, building up on the base Warriors action system. The three core elements are: 'Flow Attacks' that change depending on an enemy's state; 'Reactive Attacks' that optimally adapt to situations; and 'Trigger Attacks' that change an enemy's state. The addition of Interactive Action allows players to take advantage of the surrounding terrain and environment. In addition to climbing mountains and swimming across rivers, using grappling hooks to climb walls and launching fire arrows into oil barrels to induce explosions are among the new actions for broader strategic gameplay. ・The epic tales from the Three Kingdoms through the eyes of new and returning officers Experience the Three Kingdoms story woven through a vast roster of characters. Seven new officers (Cao Xiu, Man Chong, Xun You, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, Zhou Cang, Xin Xianying) have been added for a total of 90 playable characters; all 83 officers from the Dynasty Warriors series return, with new costumes.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Korean', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/header.jpg?t=1657631096,http://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/dw9/?lang=us,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,44,5946,,"KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","KOEI TECMO GAMES CO., LTD.","Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Online Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together",Action,"Action,Hack and Slash,Open World,Historical,Musou,Action RPG,Singleplayer,Anime,Co-op,Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,Third Person,RPG,Adventure,Beat 'em up,Online Co-Op,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_6a9749773b19bfc532f8a716004f3d333fb4b868.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_bc3f18711562cbdb594526f7b1ecfad88b8fa838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_1071b4f997bb7ddd97283fc3dc05ec145f08c11c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_750a13c069c1c0d9a5f41a447b6622d2057030d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_00cd4e157cd424983b23a0d48640aea9f3fac779.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/730310/ss_c198c86da8f96a5980b9bbf215045f8f41b28ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657631096","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256768983/movie_max.mp4?t=1576123907,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256708706/movie_max.mp4?t=1518509272"

45750,Lost Planet® 2,"Oct 15, 2010",0,"The larger than life action of Lost Planet 2 , comes to PC! Lost Planet 2 is the sequel to Lost Planet™: Extreme Condition, the landmark third-person shooter which debuted on Xbox 360 and went on to sell over 2.3 million units worldwide after its release. Lost Planet 2 offers deeper insight into the world of E.D.N III and the uncertain fate of future mankind. Already acclaimed for its visual accomplishments from the console versions, Lost Planet 2 will define the 3D experience on the PC. Stunning environments will immerse the player in NVIDIA Vision Surround technology, and the rebalanced gameplay and streamlined control mechanics make Lost Planet 2 PC the ultimate Lost Planet experience. A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Mankind has engaged in a civil war to take control of the precious Thermal Energy that powers weapons and vehicles on E.D.N. III and resulted in a separation into various factions. Players will control heroes from each faction across 6 interconnected episodes, viewing the war from the perspective of each, creating a truly unique interactive experience. With this concept, players will have the opportunity to engage in the story in a much more dynamic way as plot threads evolve from different players’ perspectives. The intense and action-packed campaign mode comes with the ability to form teams of up to 4 players online. Beyond the deep single-player and co-op modes, Lost Planet 2 is loaded with extensive multiplayer modes allowing up to 16 players to compete online, each with their own customizable avatar. No action game would be complete without an arsenal of weaponry, and Lost Planet 2 has a huge variety of hardware for players to unleash on unsuspecting enemies. Machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, lasers, sniper rifles, grenades and a host of other weapons are scattered across the game. The grappling hooks that made the gameplay in Lost Planet a true 3-D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by moving to elevated locations quickly. Lost Planet 2’s biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are VS that transform into other vehicles, hold up to three players and some that even take multiple players to operate. Key Features: Co-op action: Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4 player online co-operative play. Teamwork is the player’s key to victory as the team is dependent on each other to succeed and survive. Massive scale of enemies: Players skill on the battlefield and ability to work as a team will be tested like never before against the giant Akrid. Players will utilize teamwork tactics, new weapons and a variety of vital suits (VS) to fight these larger-than-life bosses. Beautiful massive environments: Capcom’s advanced graphics engine, MT Framework 2.0, and DirectX 11 support will bring the game to life with the next step in 3D fidelity and performance. See Lost Planet 2’s world through new eyes, with support for hardware tessellation and compute shader. Deep level of character customization: Players will have hundreds of different ways to customize their look, nom de guerre, emotes, and weapons to truly help them define their character on the battlefield. A wide array of customizable abilities range from taking less damage, to running faster to operating data posts quicker Rewards System: Players will receive rewards for assisting teammates and contributing to the team’s success Multiplayer: Compete in 16-player multiplayer matches with nine different maps and 5 different game modes including Data Post Battle, Akrid Egg Battle, Fugitive, Elimination and Team Elimination. Additional maps will be available as downloadable content after the game’s release. Exciting new VS features: Based on fan feedback, the team has implemented an unbelievable variety of Vital Suits and new ways to combat VS’s. The new VS system will have a powerful impact on the way the player takes to the war zone in Lost Planet 2.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/header.jpg?t=1636428326,http://www.lostplanetcommunity.com/,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,2021,,"CAPCOM CO., LTD.",Capcom,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure","Action,Co-op,Adventure,Third-Person Shooter,Mechs,Sci-fi,Multiplayer,Third Person,Online Co-Op,Cult Classic,Shooter,Character Customization,Singleplayer,Aliens,Co-op Campaign","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_31ebe9ef0638b7070cde8874f17bd54949e1573d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_12826d07abfe140d530e5b9dff2af5c7c5946bf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_6f91dc8ceb4181fb55b7f63cabbdf0de4a19a47c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_327e60c0a5b3a90b59d17bf41071bda2271d45d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_f87b3a62788c70f60444c6d5f1c476903851fdeb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_c4b411eab2ad2146049811a6e223f934d1bd8ec7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_e2784bc6807d227f49b02ec6bc5e20cbc2149a1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_926d4ce526c059ceb5228a46b0de42ae110ae3b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_2dc17aa52d3d4d1c5b7169f97fc4c8be13d64c74.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_ee2b6f75957ccda7bdbfaeeb66081f1b670e28be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_6634015ce26af3c9e377d6c67a78a376dfcd5f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_424e2abc2ca387e79347b71b11184aa0ed0579ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_88901375a1975c634b361b4ead50a769d17597f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/45750/ss_ce71290a2e7784eea4f5f802a08c9e883f44a5c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636428326",

231330,Deadfall Adventures,"Nov 15, 2013",19.99,"Deadfall Adventures is an action-driven first-person shooter, spiced up with elements from action-adventure games. Become an adventurer, hunt for treasures, explore unknown regions of the world and rescue the damsel in distress from the clutches of enemies, both earthly and not-so-earthly. Join James Lee Quatermain on his journey across the globe! The Story The year is 1938. James Lee Quatermain is a man of many talents, yet holding on to money isn't one of them. James is an adventurer by trade, just like his legendary great-grandfather Allan Quatermain. And he knows how to squeeze money out of this famous name of his, while at the same time despising it. Despising those who believe his great-grandfather's tales of the supernatural and those who make fun of them alike. Accordingly, Quatermain isn't all too keen on escorting Jennifer Goodwin, an US agent and former colleague of his, to an Egyptian temple structure in order to retrieve an ancient artifact - The Heart of Atlantis. Neither does he believe in the reputed invigorating qualities of this artifact, nor does he care the least that a division of the Ahnenerbe, the Nazi department specialized in the occult, is after The Heart as well. But life has its ways of changing one's perspective. Quatermain soon finds himself part of a hunt across the globe - from the stormy deserts of Egypt to the icy depths of the Arctic, and all the way to the steaming jungles of Guatemala. In long forgotten temple structures the thrill of the chase awakens the true adventurer in Quatermain, as he and agent Goodwin strive to be one step ahead of the Nazis and the Russians, one step closer to obtaining the Heart of Atlantis. And deep in these temples, where age-old guardians awake from their eternal slumber, James soon learns that his great-grandfather's stories are not as crazy as he had always believed. For all things live forever, though at times they sleep and are forgotten... Key Features Action -Adventure gameplay from a first-person perspective Set in the Quatermain-universe, created by H. R. Haggard Fast-paced action and intense, accurate FPS gun battles Adventurer equipment: compass, treasure maps, notebook and flashlight – necessary to solve ancient puzzles, find treasures and even to defeat certain types of enemies Puzzles that encourage you to explore the game environment and interact with it Environmental traps that can be used to eliminate enemies in many spectacular ways Exotic, picturesque locations from around the world – Egypt, Arctic and forgotten Mayan ruins in the jungles of Guatemala Compelling story faithful to the spirit of classic action-adventure movies 1930’s setting, including detailed weapon designs Unique adventurer-style multiplayer features and modes","['English', 'German', 'Polish', 'French', 'Russian']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/header.jpg?t=1561964976,http://www.deadfall-game.com/,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,50,1140,,The Farm 51,THQ Nordic,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure","Adventure,Action,FPS,Shooter,Multiplayer,First-Person,Singleplayer,Puzzle,Zombies,Co-op,Indie,Horror,Survival,Exploration,Open World,Action-Adventure,World War II,Strategy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e53512c37c3b4927efec4ef2dccec62084af5a57.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_e5660e00480523bab71e5758c6606de0abf9bebf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_eb71d7cb42e05f68b50d14a3d2a8bd60145acb98.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6ce7d35e3e24b9f5d35d8ebb27a0ca793ad08361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8b3791b17d55df0461262b23192a725f80de2593.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d30c427a0ce9d8b04ca0809ae71f5356e0204e73.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_3109f03c94c404b51e5775ad86a60e81e132ad19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_0ae6376d1947a3907690ed0a725e81d589cf5760.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_d4e66c6d44b80b5835acabad30cb60292267e922.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_ccc8d733e5f5e565ceaa4be6d8edcf6bdab95079.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_b6ef227c36746b589e96d57eb3b09fba2d2c1cc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_18bb9893a8c153b743417f8ada5526d7e172170b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_5b3342439c4a7fcb93ab253be906817f849da3e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_6338aab220eabdf66b1137d0ad71278b255ce39f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_8292d4dd3ea71a927d2b8b09c41a4856e72b59fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_27bd5bdb26ed53217bf31d013e795d0d5376e880.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac2586e6d2a200f246c11f399216576bad38dc1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_aac19564f29ac14d3b70f1bbae5d6233284530cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_763fee337f9ec69f6c6724460264e7c92d09c1ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/231330/ss_f70a0c7cc773129ef12bd9ebcaf9bfcba74c637c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1561964976","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2029553/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862566,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030185/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862575,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2028438/movie_max.mp4?t=1490862584,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030143/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809128,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030092/movie_max.mp4?t=1493809135"

441670,Jelly Killer,"Mar 24, 2016",3.99,"The Story In 2784 after decades of zombie invasions the scientists finally discovered the so-called zombie-genome which is able to equip dead corpses different abilities. Generally it manifested itself as recovery of motion functions and need for food. But in some cases scientsits found out that the creatures had totally independent behavior and strong desire to control and destroy all species around for their personal purposes. As soon as the military got informed of such qualities of zombie-genome, they immediately started to develop a new kind of biological weapon. After many experiments they finally made the first prototype of a biological weapon which had its own mind and shapeless jelly-like body. It had an ability to take control of any living creature. This weapon gave them an opportunityto resolve any conflict by force. But one day there was an emergency. One of the labs in Colony No4 went out of power just for a few seconds. It was enough for the young bioweapon to feel free and escape. In this game you will act like the young bioweapon. You will encounter lots of traps and puzzles. You will have to possess human bodies to pass the game to the end. Good luck!

1547580,Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part II : No Extra Regrets For The Future,"Sep 30, 2021",9.99,"About This Game This predominantly kinetic visual novel has two to three hours of gameplay for the main story and fifteen minutes for each secret scene. Whilst it would be advantageous to have played ' Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part II : No Regrets For The Future ', this episode can be enjoyed on its own. Not all characters are 18 or over. The Story Grendel Jinx : A lazy, megalomaniacal kleptomaniac Five years ago, she nearly suffered a fatal and self-inflicted accident during a school outing, saved only by the protagonist's fortuitous presence. After rescuing her, the protagonist is promptly coerced into signing a 'Friendship Agreement' form - a document designed to tie the protagonist to Grendel, both personally and financially, and then ultimately for the protagonist to join Grendel's organisation. With the arrival of the last day of term, Grendel needs to hand in her remaining homework or face the prospect of repeating a year. Drafting in the protagonist to solve her problem, Grendel is annoyed when her demands are swiftly rebuffed. Initiating a devious plan to ensure her education can progress without interruption, Grendel's actions soon attract her mother's attention, who has her own nefarious plans for the protagonist. Features By popular demand, CG graphics have now been introduced to enhance the gameplay. Funny and dramatic SHORT story. Gender selection, with gender-specific dialogue at various points in the game. Seven extra stories are available once the main story has been completed : ' Far Too Good For Us ' : Find out why the protagonist ended up in an upgraded broom cupboard (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Thine ' : A parcel arrives for the protagonist. Naturally, Grendel decides to open it (Part I) (accessed from the title screen). ' The Alien From Somewhere Out There ' : Grendel watches an age-inappropriate film (accessed from the title screen). ' Enemy Within ' : Emily is looking for something (part of the main story). ' Return to Castle Grendel ' : Grendel's classroom story continues (accessed from the title screen). ' We Want Information ' : ??? (part of the main story). ' High Jinx or Bye Jinx ' : The protagonist is a contestant in a gameshow (accessed from the title screen). Internal and Steam achievements (as per usual). Visual impairment settings, a background and CG gallery, and a music player. Both galleries are only available once the main story has been completed. Path and sound notification. Features the musical talents of Jessica Jenks. Genre : Comedy, drama, action. Romance : None (unless you count Grendels love of causing the protagonist problems). Recently signed Grendel's ' Friendship Document ' (more out of pity than anything else). Doesn't realise what exactly that entails. Whenever Grendel gets behind on homework, she takes the easy way out : Force someone to write everything up. With the protagonist now Grendel's 'Best Friend', what better way of starting this friendship than forcing the protagonist to deal with sixteen different assignments ? Miss Potts is Grendels teacher. She dislikes violence. The protagonists current boss. Soon to be the protagonists' secretary and general dogsbody. Absolutely nothing can go wrong there. Wanting nothing more than their daughter to take over the world, the best way of achieving this is through relentless indoctrination and... ultra-violent anime programs.

From the beginning to the end, the appearance of the village will be changed drastically! There is plenty of time for the game, and Mayi is also a favored one, and does not need to worry particularly about the difficulty of this game - even if she is inadvertently defeated in battle, it does not mean that the game has failed, and Mayi can even return to the game in a stronger form.

519140,Minds Eyes,"Aug 31, 2016",0,"Please read description before playing (In short - Minds Eyes is an experimental title published in 2016 as a survey to gain an understanding of what scares players, what does not, and how to create a proper horror environment. As such, Minds Eyes uses many elements that should not normally be combined in a proper horror game. None the less, through all of your feedback, videos and discussions, I was able to transform all of the successes and failures into my subsequent titles: A Girls Fabric Face and Suit 776. To that, I thank you all! :)) Minds Eyes brings you to a world of dreams. You wake up from your slumber to constantly discover you are still asleep. You venture throughout your own home as well as some pieces of your imagination to discover who or what is keeping you at sleep. Will you ever wake up? will you ever finish the journey? Venture through tense full moments of a chilling and nerve wrecking atmosphere that will keep you wondering 'When will something happen!'. Interact with the game and collect game objects which will overall affect your score in the end. Can you locate all game items?, can you make it without a single death? Check what the mind has in store. NOTE: This game is to be played with a single sitting. The estimated game time is 30-45min. This game also includes flashing lights. If flashing lights affect any of your medical conditions, please avoid the game. **SO! what is Minds Eyes really? think of it as an experiment. I have developed Minds Eyes to experiment with new mechanics, features, animations, interactions, and more. Ultimately, I am using this game to gather information in order to build my ultimate horror experience. Think of it as research and development!. I will be watching a large portion of videos that you all send out to me, and note what was good and bad. With that said, If possible, please give me a full on review of the game. Tell me what you likes, disliked and/or would change. This will ultimately let me know what to, and what not to include in future projects.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/header.jpg?t=1569810949,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,Stanislaw Truchowski,TurnVex,Single-player,"Action,Adventure,Free to Play,Indie","Horror,Free to Play,Multiplayer,Action,Survival Horror,Adventure,Indie,Thriller,Psychological Horror,Singleplayer,First-Person,Co-op,Experimental,FPS,Online Co-Op,Anime,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_4435487ee1186386e7f84e016dc7263feea0aa58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_6a433732398231d599984f5bb51441f33475e1c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_db38c8e2b9c2570dc19f6313d338ec3bd8797f82.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_fada7355c88bf4557d8ac895a8bd0682dcd2c899.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_402dd626c12ff2d97a539f662c5b6a3b84109014.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/519140/ss_4864ecf8491367c1b8dd73b419037c9ffd5feaa9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569810949",

1870170,Emiko's Pledge,"Feb 25, 2022",0.99,"Emiko's Pledge is a 2D Platform Action game based on the story of a Half Demon girl called Emiko, whose mission is to fulfill her dream of becoming the best warrior in the Demon world and also, to protect the Ettaze state from the enemies who infiltrated into the territory. There has been a long term conflict between the Ettaze and Trettaze states since the time when the Ettaze ruler decided to accept the fact that the human beings had the rights to co-exist with the demons in the Ettaze state where the majority of the state were the demons. This was the kind gesture of the ruler who gave the human beings the equal opportunities to join the universities and have a working career in the state even when some demons had a notion of looking down upon the humans. Under the leadership of Gabbon, the Ettaze ruler, the humans and demons learned to co-exist with each other which the ruler of Trettaze state could never accept. The ruler of the Trettaze state started to attack them in every possible way, banning imports and exports, barring tourists from the state to enter the territory etc. This had led to a war breaking out between the two states. However, Trettaze was the first one to officially declare the war against the Ettaze and threatened to kill all of the humans and the demons of the state. The ruler of the Ettaze had a hunch that a war between the states would break out anytime. He hired the best warriors of the state, the team of the three Demon Girls called Tri-Demon Girls who were said to be the strongest team of warriors in the state, in order to eliminate the intruders at all costs. Meanwhile, Emiko, the granddaughter of the Ettaze ruler, decided to step in at her own will and helped out the Tri-Demon girls team in her own way in order to protect the state against the intruders. Even as a half-demon she had a strong will and determination to achieve something big. Emiko with her own 'Devil Weapon' begins her journey to defeat the enemies, and to become the best warrior in the state and abroad. You play as Emiko and your mission is to fight against the enemies in order to protect the weak. Key Features: 15 Levels to play! Different kinds of enemies including three-headed monster!

471770,"In Case of Emergency, Release Raptor","Aug 29, 2016",0,"NOTE: This game is very unfinished and is free for you to enjoy because we thought what is there was fun and worth you being able to tinker with. We make no claim that this is a complete experience. It was a passion project for Chris, and a lot of time was poured into this, and we wanted to let you faff about with it. If you leave a review, then reviewing it based on what it actually is (a freebie tech demo) is appreciated. Be a raptor, feel like one, and smash robots to bits. Procedurally-assembled 3D environments set in a scenic futuristic dystopia. Free release of an aborted Early Access title. We hope you enjoy it! Note that this is an AS-IS release, based on popular demand, rather than us taking it down completely. Sell Me The Idea In One Sentence If I have to convince you why being any form of dromaeosaurid is freaking awesome, then I'm not sure we can be friends. This game is carefully crafted to give you the closest possible feeling of being one of these glorious monsters -- then turning you loose to do fun stuff. What’s The Point? 1. For the pure fun of the thing. In 1993, a certain game let you be a raptor. The controls were iffy. The levels were short and static. It's very dated. Yet many of us still dust it off periodically -- just to be a raptor. Release Raptor gives you a far more satisfying, modern, dynamic experience. 2. For a power trip. For speedrunning and finesse, you're on an invincible rampage. It's not about IF you can do it, but how WELL you do it. Your performance is evaluated, so mistakes still have consequences without interrupting the flow of the game. 3. To play with kids. I want to be able to play this with my 5 year old son, but still have dismemberment (because that's cool). How to do that without blood or gore? Robots! Little robots = pouncing targets; giant mechs = dismemberment targets. Procedural Assembly What on earth do we mean by 'procedurally-assembled?' Basically, we're using a very heavy mix of handcrafted content with procedural bits making it fresh each time. Creating unique and recognizable areas is a huge focus, because otherwise you get unimaginative 'procgen blandness.' Yuck! But we still wanted that sense of exploration, and so not chunk of level is present in every run, the layouts of the overall level (and where enemies are as well) varies quite a bit. NB: Yes, we know that’s not a velociraptor (and there should be feathers).",['English'],"“This is so cool.” AaronSayWhat “Being a raptor and doing raptor stuff, always a good time.” DemoStorm “I wish I could have finished making this, but instead you can have it for free.” Chris Park (Arcen dev)",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/header.jpg?t=1586552189,http://arcengames.com/in-case-of-emergency-release-raptor/,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,0,0,,"Arcen Games, LLC","Arcen Games, LLC","Single-player,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Indie,Adventure,Dinosaurs,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_8391ae4084299a3506e26f57d1a1799cf266e149.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_ce1be30904fae9a7f620104ae74b0bc95760d55b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_d9220b46791f15a140a0189c805ced44be399005.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_1fe3c05f43ccfe9dd4d663cdc5e4d7e8abeaa026.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_cd7a55537b646ee66caae00341b6ce4dc4854d52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_23ebb63f9f88fb712c8888c269b3c3e9d8956437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_c9e306100e143ac190a38b1a27283a9abedcb95e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_04a66bb7aabdd569b9c3b1888a67288eeb3f5d21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_e0930921ce3936bebc3dd75976823d8eba5a8551.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_584eb9bacbf4046a37eaeca8fd707d3ddcfa1f9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_ac5ad620d4e6842064cc6789ece5edc8f15f73bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_a16501e46e9163fba9bc65144bf9c97b15720f35.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_7280f45fb9b6d16b9645f29c4d9e1b455b128cdd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_12bff1b13b9dc4de77c8f3f6918a91b80cb6e7ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/471770/ss_87d1eaf76389a2f75f84e3f5ba222ebe38e65ca2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1586552189","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256669489/movie_max.mp4?t=1472063621,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256665679/movie_max.mp4?t=1465952402,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256664108/movie_max.mp4?t=1463077343"

428410,PRiO,"Mar 18, 2016",5.99,"PRiO is a visually-striking, yet challenging platformer about manipulating the environment around you. To complete a stage, you must light up all the blocks in a level. The only problem is that not every block is active at the same time. You must toggle between Red, Yellow, and Blue blocks to navigate each level without getting shot by turrets, impaled on spikes, or falling to your death. Key Features 50 Action-Packed Levels Endless Mode A Fully Functional Level editor Striking Visuals A Gorgeous Original Soundtrack Full Controller Support Color-Blind Friendly Campaign PRiO comes with 50 exciting levels to keep you busy for hours upon hours. This game is built around a simple concept of toggling the environment in order to navigate. In the beginning, it may seem easy enough to handle, but as the levels go by, you'll quickly realize the challenge that confronts you. Endless Mode In addition to a plethora of challenging levels, this game also comes with an Endless Mode. Race against a rising floor of deadly spikes by endlessly climbing higher and higher in a randomly generated level. You can never beat endless mode, but you can rack up a nice highscore by lighting up blocks in your frantic escape from an inevitable death! The Level Editor Yes, you read that correctly! You could be the proud owner of a fully functional level editor to create your own masterpiecel. Save and load levels for later! Not only that, but you can even copy the level-code to your clipboard and paste it somewhere for your friends to copy and paste into their own editor. No file transfers necessary! Visuals PRiO was meant to be a visually pleasing experience. While the gameplay itself is challenging, your eyes will have a wonderful time letting in all the beautiful lighting effects and particles. Soundtrack The absolutely gorgeous soundtrack for this game was created by Erik Danielson at Color-Blind Friendly Because PRiO is about the three primary colors, it comes with a color-blind option for those who need it. PRiO is currently only available on Windows. Please note: The game is completely functional using a keyboard and mouse, however it's highly recommended that you use a Gamepad to play PRiO.",['English'],"“sharp gameplay that’s right at the sweet-spot between too tough and too easy” Indie Game Magazine “PRiO is punishing, but in the best possible way” Alpha Beta Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/header.jpg?t=1478028084,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,9,0,,DanielDavisGames,DanielDavisGames,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Includes level editor","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Indie,Adventure,Platformer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_79ccab4e49d954efce2fa70da483d7a52f29053a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_536bb4fdca229cc1a7ab65687341aa0052558b6a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_6da76fe06e8ea30723eb371b47a5e43ca38513dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_a5911b9a3df6318a5a5ae4dd5a583afea1f3861b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_2806fe65917768d21e8a4165c6f213c2f2c88437.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_45518e5f667c5fb4d5a4efcbba69d3cb87b1248d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_972e56577c519056e1c54dc53db25d970e9e6b1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/428410/ss_add9cf6e0e090c946512879934b88d8ac02ca983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478028084",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660686/movie_max.mp4?t=1456256086

Reignite a bleak world, while unfolding its secrets in tales lost to the ashes. After countless years of restless war as a last ditch effort King Gawain turned to his Archmage to help him turn the tides of battle. The Archmage created a spell that was never used before and unleashed it onto the Kingdom. The battle ended, but everything changed. Fires started to burn blue, giving only cold instead of warmth, monsters arose from the ground, and soldiers lost their minds. Hundreds of years after the Last Battle, a lone Pyromancer awoke on the battlefield. What the Pyromancer had was unseen in years: a fire with heat. As the last pyromancer you'll have access to a lot of defensive and offensive spells, use them at your liking to overcome the difficulties of the land while trying to reginite the world. Anceps is a kingdom full of corrupted and mindless beasts. In a world such as this, use your wits, magic and agility to overcome the greatest difficulties of these lands. Can you unravel what happened hundreds of years ago, what turned this world upside down, when all you have to go on are rumors?

1108750,Timerunner,"Dec 13, 2021",6.39,"/ / There the story's hero makes a stop to embark on a quest of treasure hunting, discovering ancient artifacts in a broad variety of locations across the world – from Europe to Japan to Egypt. The Traveler is quite an exceptional character, not only because of his daring and curious personality, but also owing to his unique special power. He can slow down time to a halt and resume it at will! This ability will come in handy as Timerunner's main mechanic; you can use it to your advantage in a variety of ways – dispatching opponents, moving through the game's world, and solving puzzles, among others. Beware though – time manipulation is no easy feat and you have only so much energy at your disposal. If you run out, you will have no choice but to release time back into its natural flow and face whatever awaits you in it! But things are not as we know them on the Blue Planet. Strange forces appear to be in place that make the days on our world as different from its nights as, well, night and day! Daytime appears to be the domain of civilization, a time to tackle the modern forces of the human military, understandably feverish to get their hands on a powerful alien and stand in his way. After sunset, the world seems to be ruled by the creations of human imagination. Centaurs, ogres, phoenixes, and even dragons emerge from the darkness to oppose the Alien Traveler. To what end? How do they come to be? Some of these questions will be addressed as the hunter pursues his prizes. Apart from his ability to stop time, the Alien Traveler relies on his adventurous instincts and quickly adapts weapons secured on Earth to his needs – whether it's a pistol, revolver, shotgun, assault rifle, or a rocket launcher. Combined with his time manipulation skills, each of these can display some incredible results on the battlefield, an advantage the Traveler will need to make use of when facing overwhelming odds from diverse enemies with their own array of unique abilities.

1959400,Arobynn: The First Adventure,"May 2, 2022",4.99,"Full disclosure: the levels are a little too big and the game doesn't have that much content, but the guns feel really good and wandering around shooting things can be pretty fun IF you enjoy dodging the occasional missile and have good enough aim to shoot the frustratingly small and fast drones that are constantly hunting you down. Backstory: Most of the living word and the surface has been destroyed during the Geocubic wars of the past. A devastating technology that crystalizes structures was weaponized and used heavily during the wars which attributes to the baron wastes you will explore. You are in search of a rare herb that has begun to grow in the wastes as it is your best hope of saving your ailing grandfather. Despite the dangers that still inhabit the wastes, you head out armed with your sidearm, searching the once inhabited surface.

358000,The Curse of Nordic Cove,"Apr 23, 2015",0.99,"From Indie Developer, On The Level Game Studios: We at On The Level Game Studios are honored and thankful to Valve and our friends for all of your efforts in getting our first game, The Curse of Nordic Cove, through the Greenlight process. Originally released in a non-Steam version around April of 2013. Please note that our second game, Boo Bunny Plague, already received the Greenlight in mid-2014 and has been on Steam. We are currently hard at work on our third game. STORY: It all started in Nordic Cove, a small hamlet in the fictional state we all know today as “New York”. Once called New Hamburgerstand in the early A.D. years, it flourished with fur trades and Bacon Cheeseburgers. It was also home to the gravesite of a crusty, sorcerous, evil-naughty-person; the Viking warlord “Helfdane the Terrible!” Helfdane’s tyranny of the New Land was halted during these very rough times due to bad planning, and terrible hygiene. Today, Bacon Cheeseburgers are still at an all-time high, and New North America is on the verge of being historically ♥♥♥♥♥-slapped. An archaeologist cork-sniffer named Dr. Howard Bre, and his lovely assistant, Kayte Sparo have disturbed this ancient gravesite. Thus, fulfilling a curse which reanimated Helfdane and his minions to rip the life force from beings starting with Nordic Cove! Holy crap! Kayte’s boyfriend, Paulie Chops, must find the help he needs to turn this around, stat! This is their date night after all. Don’t act like you’ve not had a night like this. Alright! YOU deal with that Helfdane thing. We’re getting Bacon Cheeseburgers and staying warm. We’ll be cheering for you! GAMEPLAY: The Curse of the Nordic Cove is a game, by gamers, for gamers. There are familiar elements of gameplay for all gaming fans from First Person Shooter, Sports, Puzzle-Solving, to Driving, Strategic Shooting and Stealth and Dungeon Crawling. This and more thrown at you, the player, in an eccentric and thrilling Survival-Horror game like no other. Using your choice of controls being Keyboard/Mouse combo or Gamepad, you maneuver the various characters through each level to complete a task and survive. All along the way, each character you control encounters enemies of various forms that will not hesitate to attack. There are obstacles that you need to figure out how to overcome.

I saw it on the PAX East show floor last weekend and thought it was so bizarre, I had to tape it.” Jason Schrier - Kotaku “The Curse of Nordic Cove is a very unique title set in a world unlike anything you’ve probably seen or played before. Combining your golf (yes, golf) skills with your surely honed FPS talents to create a title that is borderline insanity…in a good way! When I asked the creator of how this odd combo of golf/FPS came about, he told me he was hitting the links and had a simple thought- “What if Vikings invaded the course right now?” Yeah, I was sold after hearing that too.” Curtis Stone - Front Towards Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/header.jpg?t=1572317067,http://onthelevelgames.com/,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,On The Level Game Studios,On The Level Game Studios,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Indie,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_75bdcb063135beb0acdb144572289afd7eda7ab2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_4029bb09c1d21949d7ba98505b390c82d2dd3ab3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_61fbbcd77f0a2f0706bec5083e6d906373211b5f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_e32f25b7fdbbfef41f7baa90e1ca501980009d17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_eb778892bb0737056a86f64de46200b0e9190824.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_661a013dc431c6c9443792d95d265b38c88a1e15.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_497ca73a2f0ace5668d955cb3db5ed12c921fdc3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/358000/ss_9d7949a509f30e772d11ce6101616f33a19d4a99.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572317067","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2038269/movie_max.mp4?t=1447372141,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2038292/movie_max.mp4?t=1447372242"

Using special high-tech gloves to manipulate cubes in the environment, the player solves an array of conundrums - from physics-based challenges; to 3D jigsaws; to platform-based trials.

You’re told you are an astronaut inside some kind of alien structure hurtling towards Earth, but it’s also about something deeper than that.” Under the surface, there is a subtext about games themselves – “We are conditioned to expect death and doom. We’re resigned to it. At its heart, this story is about that state of mind and how it effects the way we view our experiences, in games and in life.

More information regarding the games origins as well as the porting process are available on my blog: Adventure of Great Wolf (fäkhäßk's adventure might be a better translation) (eng) A game created by Fäkhäßk the 2nd.

841600,Aura of Worlds,"Apr 24, 2018",11.99,"Aura of worlds is a creative tactics rogue-lite platformer. Explore multiple worlds where you must utilise your creative abilities to twist adversity to your advantage. You'll need planning, wits and reflexes to make a way through these ever-changing death labyrinths. Escape flooding passages, outrun toxic pollen, face off against gargantuan bosses that have made entire mazes their home. Do you play defensively with the spear and energy shield, or swing into the fray with a boomerang and grapple hook? Do you scour the levels for potions and runes; or do you dive headfirst into the chaos? Adversity as your ally F.A.Q. Let's be transparent... 'What Gamepads are compatible?” Currently Xbox and Xbox 360 controllers though other Xinput controllers may work. NOTE: Not natively compatible with Playstation controllers yet. Keyboard and mouse works just as well. Is there much of a story in game? There's minimal story exposition as of the current build. We do plan on integrating a loose narrative as development progresses though... “I'm running the game on an old computer, how can I make it run faster?” Please see the following forum thread on optimization : “Where can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?” Please look to the forums, we check messages there each day. Feedback is welcome and there are some excellent community members who are willing to help to. 'Anything else to be aware of?' Default gamepad controls are slightly different from convention, due to optional 360 degree aiming with right analogue stick. Though buttons can be rebound to suit. It’s designed to be challenging, and death may be encountered frequently during your initial runs. Though there is no stunlocking/one-hit demises on the player. Being able to multi-task between abilities will greatly increase survivability. **The game has a steeper learning curve than the average platformer, particularly in the first 25 minutes Every challenge has multiple solutions For example, if there is a chest on the other side of a lava pit; do you...? Grapple across Bend time and bounce off enemies Use a boomerang to fetch the item Blow up the pit with a grenade; setting everything nearby alight! ... More Features Over 80 unique enemies and traps 12+ randomized level themes. Such include tidal corridors filled with mines, rising lava, caverns lined with toxic and carnivorous plants... 4+ Primary world types (grotto, gardens, temple, cold crust caverns) each with their own traps, enemies, boss and special theme layouts. A plethora of creative abilities ranging from parkour to cloaking to warping time itself! Every object has multiple uses E.g. you can grab that lantern from the ceiling, and carry it around to use as a portable light source or improvised flaming molotov... Hand crafted pixel art and animations Regular updates A unique musical score. Customize character skin and clothing colors. Permanent progression: allows you to unlock world shortcuts, new items, character backgrounds... So much more... Whilst functionally complete; the game is under active development and more content is being added.

396640,TowerClimb,"Sep 22, 2015",14.99,"TowerClimb is a difficult and rewarding procedurally generated platformer with roguelike elements. TowerClimb is set in a fantasy world where enormous and mysterious towers of ancient unknown origin stand above humanity, extending to the heavens. Humans are driven by curiosity to climb them, usually dying in the process. Struggle forward as a weak human, driven by an iron will to reach the top. The game borrows elements from the roguelike genre. A different adventure awaits each man; you will never play the same exact level twice. Run, Climb, Jump, Swim, and Fly your way up the tower's atmospheric and lethal worlds, using items and resources you find along your way. Quick thinking and strategy will keep you alive as you navigate the tower using unique platforming mechanics. TowerClimb is challenging, and rewards reflexes, skill, knowledge and problem solving ability. Quite often, The tower throws your character into dangerous situations which require you to think very carefully about your actions. A unique, randomly generated level system ensures players must always come up with interesting ways to complete a level. Hundreds of men will die before you posses enough skill and knowledge to conquer the tower. A screenshot of every man's death is saved, along with how he died, to track each and every attempt. TowerClimb at its core is an adventure platformer, with procedural levels and elements based on the rogue-like genre. It features local multiplayer support with an option for split-screen/single-screen. (a maximum of 25 simultaneous players is the limit. However, the game only supports 4 controllers (Xinput limitation). The remaining players must use the keyboard. A program like Xpadder can remap additional directinput controllers to keyboard keys) The game features a TON of content. The Tower is tall and daunting to conquer, with plenty of areas and secrets throughout the game. Getting/seeing everything will take players a long time. There's bonus modes to unlock and play on top of the main game as well. Each time you play the game, everything changes. The levels are different, random events can occur, rare items can be found, etc. The game will always keep you on your feet and give you refreshing challenges and experiences. The platforming mechanics in the game are set up to feel very tight and responsive in combination with the climbing mechanics. You always need to be on your feet and aware of your surroundings, while continually planning how to climb higher. As you progress higher, different worlds introduce new mechanics that mean your play style must evolve. 5 years in the making, by Davioware and Quazi, a team of two brothers who have been developing and playing games since childhood.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/header.jpg?t=1452807494,http://www.davioware.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,228,,Davioware and Quazi,Davioware and Quazi,"Single-player,Multi-player,Shared/Split Screen,Partial Controller Support,Remote Play Together","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Indie,Action Roguelike,Action,Adventure,Rogue-lite,Pixel Graphics,RPG,Platformer,Difficult,Procedural Generation,Great Soundtrack,2D,Rogue-like,Local Co-Op","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e31dc45661bba44a4fd063bc6ed4799411b265e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3b1f72b79430b6935a6eebfd76bbcd681c443a3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_336a61fdfb2111120c4048bc8df5416ea8dcf1b5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_85ebb18e02ec298a7c2a09a955e95dbe9a3d67e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_e7fea8248e4e93d034328bae62e45c125f31ed03.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_421e546bb493472bd837fc1c22d69b57e576f208.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_3c2415648682479e48182a8ed9296b1d1c1677c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_ae90957dd60a4ca02567a9a1e78683c2e4b45263.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_372fb5385d3f89623527898701cf2f52b842ce07.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_7ab682072d7e925760570a060e14ec340dee666d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_c099acfcb0acf6089635b6406678bd14d0a326f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/396640/ss_2ee449eb319952219dcbf40c1ece4a341ed9ed22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1452807494",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656588/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378175

868060,Immortal Darkness: Curse of The Pale King,"Oct 17, 2018",7.99,"Immortal Darkness: Curse of the Pale King is a dark fantasy dungeon crawler, that blends the best of old school dungeon crawlers with modern graphics, slick combat, and context driven audio. It features challenging real-time tactical combat, a wide variety of spells, and a dark and brooding dungeon full of lethal enemies, sadistic traps, and mind-bending puzzles. The world of Uuld is under siege by the Vampyr who have destroyed and devoured all but a few remaining strongholds of civilization. The world's last hope, Shade, an ancient and legendary vampire hunter, has been bitten in the last epic battle on the surface. You play as Shade now struggling against the vampiric curse, using it to heal yourself but at a terrible price. You must fight your way through a twisted labyrinth of horror and death to finally face the Pale King, lord of all Vampires, before succumbing to the vampiric curse yourself. Fools Rush In This is a game that will challenge you to think tactically about every situation. Rushing into a room without a good plan will most likely get you killed very quickly. Control the flow of combat by using spells and potions to slow, stun, confuse, poison, scatter, separate and take out your enemies a few at a time. The Thirst As a half-vampire your primary means of healing is drinking the blood of your fallen enemies. Using this ability pushes you closer and closer to full vampire. Use it sparingly or pay the price. There are ways to reduce your build-up of evil, such as potions and holy altars, but they are few and your enemies are many. Items are Everything With the exception of your basic melee attack, every spell and ability you will have is based on the items you choose to equip to the 6 slots in your action bar. As you progress through the game and your pack begins to fill with dozens of items, choosing what you equip to your action slots will define everything about how you play and what you can do. Secrets Within Secrets Few will find every secret or unlock every puzzle in this centuries old dungeon.

FEATURES Fight in the skies and on land: combine aerial and ground combat, having dozens of weapons in your arsenal. Encountered a group of enemies that is too tough for you to handle? Execute an aerial attack! And don’t forget to use your trusty grappling hook to throw enemies into the cloudy abyss; Customize your vessel and weaponry: choose a skyship that fits your playstyle, be it a small maneuverable boat or a heavy machine with a high-capacity cargo hold. When on foot, harness the power of firearms by enhancing them with different mods and using special abilities to destroy your foes; Build, expand and protect your aerial base: make your trusty Fathership an impregnable flying fortress and repel intruders’ attacks. Resources you gather can be used to build facilities aboard the Fathership.

1504570,Cultivation Tales,"Apr 14, 2022",19.99,"Cultivation Tales Official Discord PS: PVP mode is run on dedicated server, and it should using in-game pay to create server, if you just join server no need to pay. Cultivation Tales has two game modes: PVE and PVP. In PVE mode, players must cultivate immortals cooperatively because they are not allowed to invade other factions. But in PVP mode, you can invade other players’ factions and plunder their resources, putting everyone against one another. This mode is full of challenges, and it will conclude at the end of the battle season. When you wake up in the Four Quadrant Array, you realize you are in a chaotic land full of fantastic creatures and merciless monsters. You are bare-handed and defenseless. In order to survive in this mystery land, you must learn how to build tools, acquire resources, and make equipment and goods. One person isn’t enough – work together with your friends to build your own faction and make it stronger or join other factions if you like. Forge some powerful weapons to hunt those ancient creatures and monsters, explore this wide and mysterious land, find the truth behind it, and make your own stories. Labyrinth Territory Labyrinth territories are dangerous places with full of random puzzles and mysterious creatures. You can hunt mysterious creatures and find treasure boxes to obtain rare materials for forging equipment. Cooking systems can help you cook food to increase your strength, and the plant materials you collect on the ground can be refined to make useful medicine. Remember to use the Arcane Altar when you beat a level in the labyrinth territory. Players can get random abilities to become more and more powerful - sooner or later they will be strong enough to challenge the Lord of Labyrinth. These abilities are too powerful to control so they can only be used in this territory. Be very careful, as some undead left their belongings in this territory. If you are scared and in danger, remember to use the teleport stones to escape. To Survive Food and water are essential for survival. There are many different kinds of food in this land, all with different effects when eaten. Consuming uncertain food may bring negative effects, so be careful. All actions consume water and food, and long-distance travel will consume those items continually. There are many factors to determine how you can survive in this world, but day and night cycles and weather conditions are some of the most important. Make sure to make some suitable clothing, expand and enhance your factions, build shelters, and use fire to protect yourself from the harsh and changing environment. Create Factions Logging, Mining, Collecting, Hunting, and Becoming a Master. Use your crafting abilities, worktable, forging table, grinding table, handiwork shelf, and other tools to improve your skills and create more complex and powerful items to fight against enemies and protect yourself. Use the construction hammer to build your base and improve your base functions. Use everything you can to make the greatest and strongest faction possible. Battle System You can choose your weapons from more than 10 different weapon types, in addition to countless types of equipment to protect you from head to toes. Besides physical weapons, magic instruments and magic stones can cast elemental attacks. Use each attack method and enjoy the fun and dynamic battle system. To explore the world, walking is not the only option: you can dodge, stand on your sword to fly, run on the water, swim, and even feign death. These skills can help you gather materials more efficiently and help you fight those formidable monsters. Master the real fighting arts - increase your stamina, magic power, dodge, parry, and counterattack and become the greatest warrior in this land.

739720,Penkura,"Dec 19, 2018",9.99,"Penkura combines the wonderful worlds of real-time strategy and first-person exploration. Easy to pick up but hard to master, Penkura utilizes classic death mechanics that leave you without your equipment each time you perish. For this reason, you are able to construct your own robotic companions to help you build bases, gather resources, and protect your settlement. It encourages players to choose from a variety of approaches through which to complete their goals. Players will find themselves becoming an expert in areas entirely of their choosing. The intention is that, when the co-op is unveiled, players will find that the interaction of their unique skillsets with those of their peers creates capable and rewarding team gameplay. Penkura offers buildings, machines, bots, and items for you to construct. Most of it is made with the 'MMC' (Molecular Matter Converter) or through 'CCC' (Command Control Communication), which provides a top-down camera similar to that of classic RTS games. Should you desire, you can take control of your own intrepid bot to scout out a potentially hazardous environment or repair your base without stepping outside of the safety of your home. This is only the beginning of CCC potential; the rest is in your hands. Penkura’s crafting and base construction systems are made with co-op already in mind. Before its final release, you’ll be able to cooperate with other players to create huge, complex sets of items and stations that would normally take more than twice as long to put together. Deep beneath Antarctic ice, a Polish research team discovered an ancient temple that appeared to be a gateway to a fascinating new world.  The idea to migrate mankind to a new planet was a blessing for an overpopulated and devastated Earth. Project 'Gemini' was launched to colonize the new world. For 41 years, brave men and women traveled through the temple’s singularity. But one day, for reasons unknown, contact with the other side was severed. To learn what had happened in the world beyond, a group of mercenaries was tasked with traveling through the unstable gateway. You are one of those mercenaries.

924740,Beyond Senses,"Jan 6, 2020",7.99,"Thousands of writings and books tell of encounters with witches, ghosts, demons and the devil himself. Our world is complex and unexplored. We mostly don't notice anything of all this thanks to secret organizations whose objective is the elimination of paranormal phenomena . In Beyond Senses, you'll slip into the role of either a good hunter or an evil demon. Discover the world Beyond our Senses! Countless features guarantee a varied and unforgettable gaming experience . Beyond Senses can be played by up to 5 players! Beyond Senses is one of those rare multiplayer horror games that offer more than just one game mode! Three game modes are currently available: HUNT , EGOIST and BANISHMENT . Each game mode can be customized to your personal needs. In HUNT , your task is to weaken the wandering creature by charging blessed Energy Crystals and killing it afterwards. The more energy the Crystals receive, the weaker the creature becomes after some time. If the creature is weakened enough, you can kill it with your weapons and send it back to hell! In EGOIST you compete against your fellow players. Your goal is to conquer as many Energy Crystals as possible. Whoever has conquered the fewest Energy Crystals after a certain time will be hunted mercilessly by the wandering creature. You can use a stun gun to put your fellow players out of action for a short time and gain a time advantage. In BANISHMENT you must find all the cursed items and place them properly in a pentagram . Once you have successfully completed the ritual, you must lure the wandering creature into the pentagram to send it back to hell! Evil is all around us. Each location is individually designed and can be played in any game mode . All players should have the opportunity to create the best possible gaming experience for themselves. For this reason, new locations are constantly being added . There are currently 3 different maps available: CEMETERY FOREST HORROR HOUSE If you play as a hunter, you can currently choose between 4 different characters: John Hughes , Lauren Williams , Elijah Knight and Amy King ! As a creature, you currently have the choice between Dr. Walker (ghost) and Valac (demon). Both hunters and monsters have different 'skins', which can change the appearance of the characters. These skins will be unlocked during the course of the game by gaining experience points . From time to time there will be bonus actions or contests in which special skins can be unlocked. More hunters, monsters and skins will be added during the development of the game! So that your gaming experience does not go unrewarded, there is a level system. You start with level 1 and can work your way up to level 30. As you reach new levels, you'll unlock more skins , skills , lamps , weapons , tools and titles . Your experience points are assigned to your account and are not tied to your characters. The higher your current level is, the harder it will be to reach the next level. There is also a suitable subsystem : All tools and skills themselves can reach a higher level and become better through frequent use. Your account data is comfortably and securely stored in the Steam Cloud, so you can access it from other computers at any time! Beyond Senses offers a lot of features that we can't list completely with individual headings here. Therefore, all features of Beyond Senses that haven't been mentioned before are listed in this section: You can carry 2 of currently 4 gadgets with you: Holy Water, Sound Emitter, Incense Bomb, Devil's Trap Currently you can select 1 out of 6 possible light sources: Glowstick, Phone, Hand Lamp, Flashlight, Portable Searchlight, Night Vision At the moment you have 3 different handguns at your disposal: Remorse, Peacemaker, Vanquisher As a Hunter you can use one skill per round: Invisibility, Energy Incantation, Resurrection, Banishment, Teleportation Each Monster has 2 - 3 different skills, which can be used several times per round Currently you can unlock 5 titles: Ghost Hunter, Monster Banisher, Scaredy-Cat, Doll Hater, Living Legend .

523680,Honey Rose: Underdog Fighter Extraordinaire,"Sep 29, 2016",0,"IMPORTANT NOTE: For all information regarding DLC and the 'Pay-what-you-like' remuneration model, please read the information below! What the game is about: Honey Rose: UFE tells the story of Red, a young university student with dreams of making it big at the masked fighting tournament . She looks up to Big Blue , the current champion, and aims to meet her idol in the ring ! However, she has a history of poor class attendance , and has repeatedly failed her latest classes. This year, she made a deal with her parents : she’d either graduate, or they’d change towns. Unfortunately, the masked fighting tournament also takes place for the first time in the very town Red lives in... making it her one and only chance to make her dream come true! Thankfully, that’s where you come in ! With your guidance, she needs to balance her studies with her training so she can bring home both the champion's belt, and her graduation. The game is a life-management simulation , presented as a visual novel , with beat'em-up elements . In short: some reading, a little fighting... and lots of planning! Features: A visual novel based around choice and reactivity! See how events unfold based on your decisions... or lack of commitment! A sizeable cast of characters to encounter in dynamic events, with individual subplots to pursue! Fight for your dreams in the ring, or to get back your suit from dastardly thugs in the street! Plan ahead to make the most of the 6 months you have left until graduation! Bring home the champion's belt if you can, but make sure to ace your tests as well! Can you really do both? Pricing The game uses a 'pay-what-you-liked' remuneration model. 'Pay-what-you-liked' is a system designed after 'pay-what-you-want', except you choose to support the game *after* having played it for yourself , and determined its personal value based on your own experience. It is designed to offer each player the most choice possible in how, when and why when considering whether to support the game or not . Since Steam doesn't support 'pay-what-you-liked' or 'pay-what-you-want' remuneration systems, the DLC acts as a stand-in to offer multiple suggested tiers of support . IMPORTANT NOTE : buying DLC stands in for supporting the game at the value of the suggested tier. It will NOT enhance or change your ingame experience, you will not be getting additional content other players can't access , as the aim for this system is for the game to be the same for everyone: ie, its most complete state right off the bat! That also means the game is NOT F2P/P2W: there is NO in-game economy that allows you to pay for additional content. The game is fully available for free from the minute you start playing it!",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/header.jpg?t=1478020022,http://pehesse.fr/honey/,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,37,0,,Pehesse,Self,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy","Action,Adventure,Indie,Strategy,Visual Novel,Female Protagonist,Beat 'em up,Free to Play","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_09e82a595abc068ad4a27e8fad05576f46411d33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_787917ee9afb79fd2bf5d442d46a0b43c43d8bfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_0a67f4a7c2031187b0460de021e0d569f6875983.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a6a1bd8104824fad0b9b398ee7fd70242672bd72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_702b0c1e792a0b4f3c7dd43a1bad9193a41a725b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_6b04fc096767209ed2a15412b29b0fef97e0117f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_687a63ca117854407dfc96811f4171dd3e87bad0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_f4b67258f40fb937e28389c2db1a3032a65ffaa8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_bdb4e00f3971ba91b1bde9ba5f56d3db79654e79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_9064fd49444f8e84e60e1aaf04bd9021b3faa733.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_e87d876362f4f00f5d6e7d117040144e89d3081c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_94dc8365b330b6edb957e7ebbcb4d59145349848.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_a143f73252403c449a1dcee8566351ea3c2621cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/523680/ss_d4421cf7267c3a916f693241d2f80e193427cf9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1478020022","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670193/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458904,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256670194/movie_max.mp4?t=1473458916"

763550,A Journey Through Valhalla,"Sep 12, 2021",5.99,"A Journey Through Valhalla was developed by three friends in their spare time and is by no means a AAA game. It still gives you several hours of fun and even more so if you like beating up your friends! Discover the worlds of Yggdrasil as you and your teammates help the Gods in this three player co-op Action RPG where you use your powerful abilities to lay waste to the enemies of Valhalla. Level up and build your character with our advanced skill tree and powerful weapons. Co-op Don't worry if you can't handle the boss alone. Just bring a friend or two along to keep the boss occupied while you stab him in the back. But make sure not to accidentally stab your friends while you're at it! Dying Death is not the end. Each try will get you and your team closer to your goal. You probably want to change tactics if you keep on dying though. Also, watch out for that friendly fire! Looting Look for the loot to find a host of powerful weapons, and useful armor to protect you in battle. Or maybe collect as much valuable items you can carry to sell for traits and gear back at the shop.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763550/header.jpg?t=1633891267,https://valhalla-game.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,20,0,,Team Sämst,Team Sämst,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Online Co-op,Steam Achievements","Action,Adventure,RPG","Souls-like,Co-op,Dungeon Crawler,PvE,RPG,Action RPG,Action-Adventure,Action,3D,Third Person,Colorful,Fantasy,Loot,Magic,Medieval,Adventure,Mythology,Combat,Multiplayer,Co-op Campaign","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763550/ss_8b247609fe348e5674cfdd14e117d598c558f41c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633891267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763550/ss_653c0ac4d029db76f8738fee79ec14918c432d29.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633891267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763550/ss_461edf1fcb6599a89516513f83352f8e20234d33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633891267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763550/ss_57512a1c4ff8000cc49c06fdfb05e51a6b819cda.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633891267,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/763550/ss_557bf575f3c4c8aaf9dd674eaafa4a064d1665b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633891267",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256841593/movie_max.mp4?t=1626026817
312540,Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim,"Apr 28, 2015",19.99,"Red-haired adventurer extraordinaire Adol Christin has finally reunited with his best pal, Dogi, and is eager to set sail for new adventures in Afroca. It seems fate has other plans for him, however, as a pirate captain named Ladoc makes him an offer he simply can't refuse: a chance to explore a dangerous, uncharted archipelago in the Atlas Ocean that may hold treasures of heretofore unseen value. Never ones to back away from a good mystery, Adol and Dogi both agree to join Ladoc on this expedition aboard his ship, the “Tres Mares” -- but no sooner does it weigh anchor than the Romuns, their sights set on the same curious islands of Canaan, attack the wayward pirates and ultimately knock Adol overboard, leaving him for dead. Some time later, he washes ashore in Canaan itself, alive but weakened, rescued and resuscitated by two young girls named Isha and Olha who sport long ears and bushy tails. They are of the native “Rehda” tribe, and it seems Adol is not the first human to arrive here -- nor are humans particularly welcome... Come experience the very first 3D Ys game as you've never experienced it before! Already the foundation upon which Ys: The Oath in Felghana and Ys Origin would later be built, this version of Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim comes equipped with an original translation and brand new, entirely unique gameplay features such as the addition of a super hardcore “Catastrophe Mode” for fans of the later titles, full widescreen support, map warping, Steam achievements and leaderboards, and even a full digital art book packed with concept sketches, hi-res character portraits and original production PSDs. See what you've been missing with this definitive version of the game that brought Ys into the modern era! Key Features: Fast, real-time combat centered around elemental swords with unique magical abilities Enormous screen-filling bosses set to quintessentially Ys rock music composed by the legendary Falcom Sound Team jdk A deep and involving story that ties into Ys history and serves as a cornerstone of series lore Brand new “Catastrophe Mode” where healing items can’t be purchased or stored, to create a gameplay experience more in line with later entries Adjustable high-resolution PC graphics and gamepad support Newly-added ability to warp among checkpoints Steam achievements and leaderboards",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/header.jpg?t=1624576503,http://www.worldofys.com/ysvi/,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,16,842,,Nihon Falcom,"XSEED Games,Marvelous USA, Inc.","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Adventure,RPG","Action,RPG,Adventure,JRPG,Great Soundtrack,Action RPG,Anime,Singleplayer,Difficult,Fantasy,Classic,Hack and Slash","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_3ab5238a287349e471ef58215eb5662066d346ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_424e93b39899f5258a7ebb5f6264ca85092e1e25.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_1eddaf92fb88451805687c88153075122985f34d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_f92a308d6fc372c24b79c9f066b80e24f8c1863c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_e43a15c6f326c18e3d90b08b67a9cba1653d4846.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_ebbceb1785e8727124462f2bce97dbd6441a226b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_a08213c3a18f050e5b10d2a7bc5ee6affaabfc00.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_d17097dd5e5d7d246f4af41b212f913d6290e494.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_49366f5ec86372bb74aa43c9bb847245407d6568.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_4c8e6394118a35e4669e4f068a32af8522a20cfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_723c4f042f6f1d8eed835dd9da89036810c60746.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_0f9d8b0e5d1895f3928b643378d2b33f50cadd7c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_a1a2ea15bcefb26a0027618a47376dfd2d5d0835.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_cffcc2616fe13ef3ce43122df6e6c8fbec2359fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_0a932132173b1b4af96dbeb43fe14211fb1c9455.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_2961daeceaedb598589ce9604fd9a0f1856c216b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_78c8b3444c2d767c9b94971f316e9aec2e909cb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_8873bb105ad9ea3021ef0ec96bab9ae736367b6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_1853d90b9754ec51683b3de4477ba0b681c3b6fd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_2e9c218b56c0831a356672b8dd3f99edcaefc693.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/312540/ss_cd811e10536cca7e7974138bcd694b9a62ad68a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1624576503",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2038456/movie_max.mp4?t=1447372602
1715970,ZEE.END,"Sep 14, 2021",13.99,"During the arms race, the government of a small country, in the absence of large budgets, decides to go the other way. Fearing for his sovereignty, contacts a secret corporation for the development of biological weapons of mass destruction, with name - Zero Experimental Establishment or ZEE. The project is allocated funds and a place of development - a remote corner of the country - the Montib island, cut off from the world, with a small population and no modern infrastructure. The deafening success of experiments is comparable only with the fundamental failure of the all development. The next monthly report says about the fall of a helicopter with samples of biological weapons on the island. And a week later, after reports of the observation - of infection of local residents, communication with the employees of the corporation, and indeed with anyone in general, disappears. The government makes a decision in secret from the world community and, despite the protests of the residents of the country who have relatives there, cut off the entire Montib island from the external world, and under pressure forces ZEE to investigate what happened. Despite the military patrolling the sea around the island and the likelihood of dying from the virus, the flow of people trying to get there is not running out. Someone wants to find relatives and friends, help residents, and someone wants to take possession of the abandoned property of a corporation or just have fun in a place where the laws no longer work. Why are you there - you decide. The release version of the game will include: - We have a huge map 20 by 20 kilometers, to reach the other end you need at least an hour and a half, with villages, cities and military bases - The map contains areas of summer, autumn and winter, with different air temperatures - Spawn is located along the entire southern coast (no respawns in the center of the map near military bases with top loot!) - Two factions. Marauders and Hunters (players will be divided into two factions, depending on their actions. Marauders will be those who kill players, Hunters - who kill bots and marauders. Each faction will have its own camp with a store) - Extraction of resources, from the simplest tree to valuable gold (gold will be a currency that can be exchanged for some things) - Transport with physics close to real, with repairs and refueling (one or two helicopters per server, which will not be easy to assemble) - Crafting and cooking (such dishes as ukha or mushroom soup will give an hourly buff of one or another characteristic, so cooking makes sense) - Building bases (wood - stone - metal) - Missions (missions will appear on the map, simulating various situations)",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/header.jpg?t=1641121578,https://vk.com/zee_end,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,Contains scenes of violence and cruelty and blood,T.LEE,T.LEE,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,LAN PvP","Action,Adventure,RPG,Simulation,Early Access","Action,Survival,Open World,Zombies,RPG,PvP,Multiplayer,Shooter,Looter Shooter,PvE,Base-Building,Exploration,First-Person,Singleplayer,Third Person,Atmospheric,Driving,Adventure,Character Customization,Early Access","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_9afd0aa78f9b38b055b10ca03e484a742552ae5c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_552db9fb0a931736fef24dc071516fd777b4c4b7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_157b03d0d14da78c3328fa64d2744f4082580d29.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_d4dc4bbd3bcb822906f451461d6601b9e7a671df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_07f599617ef60d161fa6dad665b85cbe963bcb8c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_807888e769c983f29625257f0e97ccb497f8d9dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_84390897d00c38e52f90f579ef25ea51cf518024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_aba42710bba1617e6c7e795f7e17606fb04483ab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_f4a14e6e0f58b6095b593a14cffe6ed392850f7b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_2b430f088eeb6b7f6fa381a8a89b1631454dd649.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_b161f98a94efba392223e759beeedcaef309f326.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_eebe61ed136f3bf3396763b14b35261ae4fa9fa6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_66b1c2268c788a6f891b489830a72cd76c4d4809.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_30d3be8329690976a06e7f768874d64f2f080881.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_ad2d0169bf187ef36bee24160b5100cadb0ea05f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_6a1a6d381e0f884b2f99a982c52566e8dba9d9da.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_8ed31bd6caa8b8cc7c3c71b6d8198b229ee9cdc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_d96d222af4def3d0793710ad82261e4cd63bc3b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_82c28faa015692bc73130aec0c2fc6497805584c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_14ae0352de75b5d23ef807ef2870ba9e4fcc1be2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_ea970a0761dccace23a98d7f2be90aac454261d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_579e1cf01b991a524fcc40a7ec7543f9f399d29b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_dba6f90fbceaadb6c17fbb51d85482ee047f8cb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_9d4950216375d822e6e8a0699545e0cc257a430c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_bea2105452eb7ffaf27cafbb13dd932d784f7c52.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_c55fa0dcd07d1e1eb8a788387b74d9dd3399b3d8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_8df38323ed1d6e6200fa1061b33ed1aac41c6080.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1715970/ss_c8221fa5de4c40544d669576aa21e37976c28658.1920x1080.jpg?t=1641121578","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256845918/movie_max.mp4?t=1632461080,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256854236/movie_max.mp4?t=1633170362"
1557480,Project MIKHAIL: A Muv-Luv War Story,"Nov 1, 2021",19.99,"-It’s Your Responsibility to Change the World- Set on an Earth where mankind is being steadily annihilated by the alien invaders known as the BETA. Over the course of decades, humanity has come to rely on humanoid weapons called Tactical Surface Fighters in their attempts to resist the alien onslaught. What choices will YOU make in a world that’s heading towards destruction? Your actions will change the course of history for the whole world... Project MIKHAIL is a mecha action game with three different modes of play: 1. A Story Mode with a full story for players to enjoy. 2. Frontier Mode, an online mode where all users inhabit a shared world, and each player’s actions have an influence on the story's outcome. 3. A PvP mode where players fight each other in their Tactical Surface Fighters. [Story Mode] In Story Mode, the player takes the role of Shirogane Takeru, the hero of Muv-Luv Alternative . Throughout the story, the player will be asked to make choices. How the story ultimately ends depends on the choices the player makes. In Story Mode, the player not only makes their own story, they also get to construct their own personal Tactical Surface Fighter mecha. By defeating the BETA and putting together the parts they drop, they’ll get to make their own ultimate fighting machine. [FRONTIER MODE] An online mode where all players inhabit a world where they're tasked with fighting the BETA invasion of Japan and saving the world. Every player’s actions will have an effect on the balance of power between various factions and individuals, each with their own designs and plans for the future of Earth. Everything they do will change the state of the war. Think YOU know what we have to do to save the world?

1144900,Pension Day,"Sep 3, 2019",0.99,"Don't you just hate it when you need to be somewhere and those pesky old folks are clogging the sidewalks, impeding your progress? If so you are not alone. Hugo Banchee is a testosterone-fueled hulk of a man with serious anger management issues and he is in a hurry to get to the gym. Trouble is, it happens to be Pension Day. Hugo knows his route will be blocked by dithering, doddering old people who flock to the Post Office each Tuesday to pick up their pension payments. Even Hugo's therapist cannot seem to calm him down this time! Can Hugo reach his destination without upsetting too many old people? Or will he bump into so many that his overwrought heart will implode, leaving him dying in the street? You must preserve some semblance of Hugo's respect for the elderly long enough for him to reach the sanctuary of his beloved gym in Julian Henley's latest hilarious social commentary on modern life! Gameplay The game mechanics are deceptively simple (you will master them immediately but die many times). As Hugo walks up the road you must control his direction using the arrow keys thereby preventing collisions with other characters and vehicles. Colliding with the elderly characters will enrage Hugo, putting stress on his heart and reducing his health. Hugo's health is also dented by colliding with moving vehicles. Helping an old man across the road is a calming experience and will boost Hugo's health, as will catching tranquilizing capsules which occasionally fall in Hugo's path. Keep Hugo alive long enough and you will eventually reach the destination and victory!",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/header.jpg?t=1651033778,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,There is a small amount of mildly offensive language.,Julian Henley,Julian Henley,Single-player,"Action,Casual","Action,Casual,Arcade,Pixel Graphics,2D,Cartoony,Funny,Linear,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_3554f50d7f2b332e4dd5544aaea9721424eb3c27.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_77f06fc8e4502728f42cd92855a089303f282b01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_449d5dc65de5556cf6a4751d88a45cc1fe2a8db6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_b61f9f1d33f7a02025dd47ccae811f5a581c47b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_9690b616cae80d95cd31c91d01e9e50819e73230.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_17e8964a5be9ce7a3c3cb031ad5882d565d63813.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_50141b7333cba15cdc983aa2806b9590db466131.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144900/ss_f393400e7addb1cfdac84fde14e3d6cd93d41f79.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651033778",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759250/movie_max.mp4?t=1566330531

Play alone, in cooperative mode or challenge a friend in PVP mode, here competition is what counts!

In 'Geometric Feel The Beats' you don't have to worry about that, you have fun doing the missions and collect points. Accumulating ranking points is not just for you to show others your ranking, they are also for buying upgrades for your spaceship. Using ranking points can make you drop some rankings, so analyze the timing of the purchase well, but buying upgrades makes your life easier in the game. Here you decide! Stay tuned to the Power up’s that appear in the stage, they are accompanied by big surprises! Game Modes: Adventure: Perfect for “lone wolves”, in this mode each stage is made up of two missions. You will have fun discovering new “AIs” and finding ways to overcome them. Co-op: In cooperative mode you start from scratch again. It does not take into account your advancement, upgrades or adventure mode ranking, but there is a crucial difference ... YOU WILL NOT BE ALONE! A friend will accompany you, helping you in the challenges of adventure mode, because everything is more fun with a friend! In this mode we have an exclusive ranking for players and their friends and the rules for purchasing upgrades remain the same. With teamwork you have achieved scores never imagined before! PVP: Who doesn't like to compete against a friend? In this mode, hitting your opponent gives you an advantage, he will be paralyzed for a few seconds while you complete your mission! There will be three missions per game, the one who wins the most missions wins. The rules remain the same as for adventure and the mission is the same for both players. Who will win this duel? – Ranking Who will remain at the top? Who will be the fastest and most accurate player? These questions will be answered here! There will be two classifications, one for adventure mode and one for cooperative. In advance, we warn you that the more you miss, the more points you will lose, which could cause the ranking to drop. - Steam Community: Between one explosion and another, we would like to see your most fun moments during the game.

It matters not if you are a seasoned veteran of the gaming world or if you never touched a gamepad before: It just takes 4 buttons and 1 analog stick to have endless fun with your friends! Each arena breaks differently! Some arenas have special mechanics, like turning you into a dragon or sending in mysterious gifts. 10 Power Ups to spice up the combat even more! Everyone has a dash. Fight N’ Fall is best enjoyed with friends, so call your buds and invite them over for the fight and falling of a lifetime!

We wanted to create a short visceral, realistic experience stripped of user interface, lobbies, scores, levels, and other visual intrusions that might distract. There were some key elements of fighting a dragon that we wanted to capture and we felt VR was uniquely qualified to convey: Face to face with a large scale hostile creature trying to kill you Using a sword and a shield Fire! Nowhere to run! This started out as an internal experiment to learn some things about VR’s capabilities, be reductionist in our designs, etc. We felt that the experiment was successful enough to release as a free experience to share.

1207390,Ghosts'n DJs,"Feb 6, 2020",0,"In a parallel universe where a life is in a 16-bit pixelated form, the music scene has been dominated by fake artists and DJ’s. They rise to fame and become superstars in the media because of two important tools. The first are ghost producers they hire to make music for them so they can release it under their names. The second is a dangerous power brought from the Pit of Averno. This mystical evil power is called MONEY. These evil creatures are known as Devil Goata, Paul Douchebag, Paris Sheraton, Steve Karaoki and Pete Bullshit. Their goal is to destroy the love for the music in this universe by making all of it to sound the same and stupid, using a terrifying and malicious artifact known as THE TEMPLATE. There is still chance for real music to survive. Help Dr. Kucho! on his crusade for the love of music. Fight the fake and avoid cheesy music to poison the weak minds. Find the template and destroy it so ghost producers won't be able to make music for anyone and fake artists will be forced to live by their own merits… if they can. It’s time to send these creatures back to the 16-bit hell they came from using musical supports as weapons. Ghosts‘n DJ’s is a project born from the love of music and it’s a tribute to the arcade games of the 80’s and 90’s. No ghost programmers were used in the making of this video game. Ghosts'n DJs is fully created and starred by Dr. Kucho! , one of the most industrious and long-standing producers and DJs ever after almost three decades in the industry, with a portfolio of more than 300 house music releases, including his latest hit “Can't Stop Playing”. The game proudly features deadmau5 , the groundbreaking electronic artist who has changed pop culture as we know it with albums such “4 × 4 = 12”, “For Lack Of A Better Name” and “Random Album Title”. He’s also critically acclaimed for his singles 'Sofi Needs A Ladder', 'Ghosts 'n' Stuff' and 'I Remember”. deadmau5 kindly allowed the use of his tracks “Polaris”, “4Ware', “GG” and 'Three pound chicken wing' to be part of the soundtrack of this game. Features Satirical pixel-art run and gun side-scrolling action platformer. Inspired by the classic arcade hit Ghosts'n Goblins. Set in a parallel universe in which the music scene is being dominated by fake DJ’s. 3 stages, 5 different enemies, walking and flying enemy behaviors, and one final boss. 4 regular weapons + deadmau5 head as armor and super weapon. 4 levels of difficulty for beginners and ultra hard core players. Super fast and fluid action gameplay. CRT filter for arcade feel. FX sounds based on 8 bit YM2203 and MOS6581 sound chips. Fully created by the house music legend Dr. Kucho! Featuring deadmau5.",['English'],"“In Ghosts’n DJs you can see Kucho’s devotion for the classic Ghosts'n Goblins.” IGN “You’ll have to run, jump, and climb your way across each level.” Siliconera “It is fun to play, feels a lot like it’s GnG inspiration and does make you smile – especially when you see some of the DJs combat moves.” Alpha Beta Gamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1207390/header.jpg?t=1581019279,http://www.drkuchogames.com,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,14,0,,Dr. Kucho!

723110,Scrap Galaxy,"Dec 1, 2017",7.99,"Scrap Galaxy is a local build-and-destroy deathmatch game for up to 4 players. It is a 2D top-down shooter taking place out in space in a galactic junkyard. In this setting, the players are trying to survive by constructing space ships. The game is round-based and each round is divided up into two phases: build phase and battle phase. During the build phase, each player gets a number of components and has to assemble a spaceship from them within a certain time limit. During the battle phase, the players pilot the ships. They battle against the other or team up against the garbage drones living in the junkyard. The randomness and unpredictable nature of the game makes every round into a new challenge, because you always have a new ship to battle with, raising the stakes and making the game quite addictive. Key Features Creativity under time pressure mixed with action-packed spaceship battles. Deathmatch until only one player remains. A new ship is constructed each round. Scrap King is like Deathmatch but the winner keeps their ship and can continue to build on it. Co-op allows the players to fight together against garbage drones. The players continues to build on their ships after each wave of enemies. Bots fill lasts slots if you are less than 4 people playing. Original soundtrack made by Connor O.R.T. Linning. Numbers 1 to 4 players playing together in local multiplayer. 11 different components to construct spaceships from. 3 different game modes. 3 different deathmatch rule sets. 6 Different maps. 10 Co-op levels. Controls Gamepads are highly recommended for singleplayer and multiplayer. Gamepads tested are Xbox 360 gamepad, Xbox One Gamepad and Steam Controller.

380990,B.A.D Battle Armor Division,"Aug 18, 2015",5.99,"B.A.D is an intense and enjoyable Shoote'em up game that captures the feeling of controlling a mass-produced humanoid robot (Battle Armor) piloted by a single soldier while keeping the realistic fast-paced action in a dramatic large scale conflict, from various Factions of Earth and Mars. More than 200 years had passed since colonization on Mars had begun. A slow process of terraformation had begun, occurring in the atmosphere and modifying its chemical composition. Despite the rarefied air and radiation, millions of people inhabited the planet. Mars was exploited for its mineral resources, but it served above all to reach the moons of Jupiter. In 2437, a new mineral called Ixenio was discovered on those moons. Ixenio was known to be indestructible over time, the hardest of hardest metals and able to generate an incredible quantity of energy through exposure to photon beams... it was the new black gold. In 2512, Mars was aware that it had become a superpower and it took advantage of the conflict between the Euro America League and the Asiatic Union to form and declare the Independent Martian Kingdom, I.M.K. The Asiatic Union sided with the I.M.K. while the Euro American League still claimed its own rights. All out war was, by then, at the door... The I.M.K. suddenly attacked Moon Base, using the asteroid fortress Abraxis as its logistic base. It conquered Moon Base and exploited it to send troops on Earth in support of the Asiatic Union. It was the beginning of Interplanetary War I. Key Features: Action Shooter with a tactical approach. 360 degree shooting system. More than 16 level: fight on earth and in space.

A medieval metropolis that went bonkers after the people discovered goop - a raw fluid that provided energy, skin cream, bread spread and powered diesel engines. And it turned the people of Ravensdale into raging, bloodthirsty monsters. Lucky for them they have you, leading a pack of lunatic knights on a killing spree to save the city. Gameplay Rogue Stormers combines classic run ‘n’ gun gameplay with a modern art style, twin stick shooter configuration and all the good things rogue like has to offer. Did we mention that you can have up to three friends join you on your rampage in either online or couch co-op mode? Your goal is to fight and beat the ultimate evil threatening Ravensdale - but in order to beat him, you need to fight your way through 7 increasingly challenging levels. If you die, you'll be back at square one. Earned perks are yours to keep, allowing your character to grow stronger with each new raid. Our technology enables us to layer and combine level chunks to create meaningful level combinations with infinite replayability. An ever-growing cast of enemies, hazards and loot is layered within each chunk, generating incredible diversity. Tons of different upgrades and weapons will cause each new session to play in a unique fashion, depending on which weapons or upgrades you pick and get. Adding to that are five unlockable character classes, each with its own skills and base weapon. The further you delve into the vast undercity of Ravensdale, the more you will learn about the city's history and that of its citizens, as well as the tragic backgrounds of the five heroes who took arms to save the city. All these factors combined determine how you’ll engage the sprawling city of Ravensdale. Will you go toe to toe with your enemies or pick them off them from a distance? Will you cripple your enemies, block attacks or just blast everything apart with pure damage? Features: I'm So Ronery: Single player mode Gun Together for Fun Together: Up to four players local/online co-op All You Can Kill Buffet: 5 character classes to decide whether you feel like murdering people with fire or goop or guns Sick Arse Biomes: All generated procedurally with random placement of enemies, traps and upgrades for infinite replayability Farting Angels And Things that Have Teeth But Shouldn't: Deal with classic orcs, goblins, floating weapon platforms, eldritch horrors and battlegates bristling with weapons Set Things on Fire: Trigger environmental chain reactions that will kill both you and your enemies, but idk, it looks cool It's So Shiny: Game world modeled in blistering 3D Discover New Stuff: Unlock tons of crazy updates and new weaponry that give you even more ways to murder your enemies.

1100180,Yousei Daisensou ~ Touhou Sangetsusei,"Aug 2, 2019",10.99,ゲームの進め方 ・ストーリー 　いつものようにせわしくなく暮らしていた氷の妖精チルノ。 　なんと、留守にした間に何者かに家を破壊されてしまった。 　破壊された家の上には謎の旗が立ててあった。 　その旗には見覚えのある妖精達の絵が…… 　怒り狂ったチルノはその旗の持ち主に宣戦布告を出す。 　そう、これが妖精大戦争の始まりだった。 　（詳しくは 　　　　「東方三月精　～ Strange and Bright Nature Deity」 　　　　　　第二巻の読み切り「妖精大戦争」を参照） ・ルール 　チルノを操作し、三妖精（サニーミルク、ルナチャイルド、 　スターサファイア）を撃破します。 　チルノは 敵弾を凍らせる能力 を持ちます。 　これをうまく駆使して妖精最強を名乗りましょう！ チルノを操作する ・上下左右 　　 チルノの操作 ・SHOTキー（Zキー)　　　　　　　　 ショット 　　溜撃ち　　　　　　　　　　　　　 アイスバリア 　　 ＊今作はSHOTキーではオート連射になりません ・RAPIDキー（Cキー か Ctrlキー）　　 ショット連射 ・BOMBキー（Xキー） 　 パーフェクトフリーズ ・SLOWキー（Shiftキー）　　　　　　 低速移動 　　＊SHOTキー押しっぱなしでも低速移動になります ・PAUSEキー（Escキー）　　　　　　 ポーズ 画面を見る ・やる気 　　チルノの根性ゲージです。 　　ミスすると １００％減ります。 　　 ９９％以下の状態でミスをするとゲームオーバー です。 ・こおりパワー 　アイスバリアをはるためのパワーです。 　常時 自機の上に表示されている数字と同じ物 です。 ・パーフェクトフリーズ 　１００％以上の時、パーフェクトフリーズが使用できます。 ・こおらせた面積 　敵弾を凍らせた総面積（累計）です。 　ショットの強さと直結しています。 　沢山凍らせれば凍らせるほどショットが強くなります。 ・レベル表示 　ショットのレベルです。 　凍らせた総面積が増えるとレベルが上がります。 敵弾を凍らせる！ 　　「 ちょっと敵が妖精の癖に弾幕濃すぎなんじゃない？ 」 　　そうですね。 　　　＊弱いチルノの主観ですので、いつもより多めの弾幕に見えています。 　　しかし！　チルノはそんな事に臆しません。 　　チルノには秘密兵器があるのです。 　　それが「 アイスバリア 」　ショットの溜撃ちで発動します。 　　アイスアタックは自機のすぐ近くしか攻撃できませんが、 　　何と、触れた敵弾を凍らせる事が出来るのです。 　　しかも凍らせた敵弾に当たっても大丈夫。 　　氷が砕けると敵弾も消滅してすっきり！ 　　さらに 凍った敵弾は新たに別の近くの敵弾を凍らせます 。 　　 　　 弾幕の濃い場所を狙って アイスバリアを当てれば連鎖的に 　　敵弾を凍らせて、敵の弾幕を壊滅させる事が出来るのです。 　　 　　どうしても避けられない場合、チルノの代わりにあなたが 　　頭を使って、効率よく凍らせるパターンを見つけましょう！ こおりパワー！ 　　アイスバリアはいつでもフルパワーで出せる訳では 　　ございません。馬鹿だって疲れます。 　　 　　こおりパワー（自機の上に表示されている％）が 　　 ３０％以上無いと出せません 。 　　 　　１００％に近いほど、氷の持続時間が長くなります。 　　３０％では一瞬で氷は砕けてしまいます。 　　 　　こおりパワーはアイスバリアを貼ると０％になります。 　　 　　 こおりパワーを回復させる方法 。 　　　・時間と共に徐々に自然回復（ゆっくり） 　　　・ ショットを敵に当てる（かなり高速、ボス戦では基本） 　　　・ザコ敵を倒す（一瞬で回復） 　　　・敵弾にかする（上級者向けだが、高次面では必須） 　　　・溜め続ける（通常より若干速く回復） 特殊な敵弾に注意！ 　　「 連続してアイスバリアを張り続ければ楽勝じゃん？ 」 　　 　　いえいえ、敵も馬鹿ですが少しは対策します。 　　以下の攻撃に注意！ 　　 　　・ 燃えている炎弾 　　　この敵弾は 凍りません 。氷の上を貫通して飛んでいきますので 　　　注意してください。 　　　 　　・ レーザー 　　　 氷を破壊して貫通します！ 　　　破壊時に破片が飛び散るので、それに当たるとミスと 　　　なります。 　　　自機の近くでレーザーに氷を破壊されないように注意！ 氷は面積！ 　　チルノは纏まったたくさんの敵弾を凍らせるよりも、 　　広く散らばった敵弾を凍らせる方が好みです。 　　 　　ゲーム画面を１００％としたとき、 　　 凍らせた部分の割合 がボーナスとなります。 　　敵弾の発射地点を狙って凍らせるより、十分広がってから 　　凍らせた方が面積は広がります。 　　 　　凍らせた総面積は、ステージ１からの累計です。 　　これが一定数を超えるとショットレベルが上がります。 　　 　　ボスが硬くて倒せない場合、積極的に面積が増えるように 　　凍らせていきましょう！ その他の仕様！ 　　やる気が増える条件 　　　・敵弾を凍らせる 　　　・敵にダメージを与える 　　　　（ショットより 氷のダメージの方がやる気増加率が高い ） 　　１００％単位で自機が一つ増えたと同じ効果です。 　　最大１０００％です。 　　 　　パーフェクトフリーズが増える条件 　　　・敵弾を凍らせる 　　１００％以上増えないのでバンバン使っていこう！ 　　 　　パーフェクトフリーズは全画面凍らせます。 　　アイスバリアでは凍らない 炎弾も凍ります 。 　　まさにパーフェクト！ よくわかんない 　　なんかこのゲーム、難しすぎるし、操作も難解だし、 　　会話も支離滅裂だし、よくわかんない。 　　 　　どういう感じで攻略すればいいのか？ 　　ピンと来なかった場合はデモプレイを見てみましょう。 　　タイトル画面で放おって置くとデモプレイが見られます。 　　 　　なお、この操作説明はゲームプレイ中のポーズ画面 　　からも見る事が出来ます。 　　 　　会話が支離滅裂なのは妖精だからです。 　　戦争が終わったら何を言ったのかすっかり 　　忘れている事でしょう。,['Japanese'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1100180/header.jpg?t=1597739954,http://www16.big.or.jp/~zun/,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,上海アリス幻樂団,"Mediascape Co., Ltd.","Single-player,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Bullet Hell,Faith,Shoot 'Em Up,Anime","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1100180/ss_dfb453f74bbf87233d9011af92be3ebe89a454df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1597739954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1100180/ss_62aa9a4d2a4732a705a8ccade10d61d1ea4ffe96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1597739954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1100180/ss_4e77107d2a0d74e656bbceadd6588ea04ddab139.1920x1080.jpg?t=1597739954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1100180/ss_7bbc4f46aa087001604a83f5a101de934322314c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1597739954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1100180/ss_a63018a11d0436b5589128a2cb69ee8e0b33fe91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1597739954",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256752802/movie_max.mp4?t=1563343042

Your objective is to clean up more than 100 files to finally access a part of the game corrupted by a panoply of bugs and viruses. The main character can propel himself, jump, sprint, shoot, pilot a ship, use grapples, swim at any speed and in any direction as long as he masters the key combinations wisely. You can play at your own pace in normal mode or activate the speedrun mode and try to get the best medal. A ranking system is also present to compare your times with those of players around the world.

392030,Murasaki,"May 12, 2016",4.99,"A mystical world on the edge of destruction. Unlikely saviors joined by fate and duty. A mission driven by music, magic...and survival. Murasaki is a hybrid shmup and puzzle game that creates intense and high-speed gameplay against a serene landscape with gorgeous music. With the ability to only fire a single bullet at a time, you must use cunning, angles and timing to survive. Random shapes will appear as the levels progress: these designs will trigger massive explosions when shot. If you can bounce corresponding shapes off of each other, they'll create a chain reaction that, with a little luck, will wipe the screen. Don't wait too long, because the enemies will overwhelm you in a second! If you can't get a clear shot, each character has a special attack with limited uses. Use them wisely to get out of a tight situation or to put the finishing blow on one of several bosses! Characters Kairi The older of the heroes, Kairi acts as a big brother, though he's not related to Satsuki. His movements are slow, but his long range shot can reach anywhere on the screen, perfect for ricochet combinations. This however, also means that you don't have rapid shots. Kairi's special attack is a spiraling explosion that reaches most of the screen. This bomb can absorb enemy's bullets and destroy multiple targets. Use it wisely. Satsuki The younger hero, Satsuki is impetuous and headstrong, and it shows in her attack formation. Satsuki can move across the screen quickly, but the range of her shots is very short. Sometimes they won't reach the enemy. However, using her speedy shots, you can bounce the explosive blocks farther than Kairi, which makes it easier to create a chain attack with other blocks. Just be careful not to bounce them too far, or the explosion won't reach the enemy! Her special attack is a cross-formation energy wave. It hits harder than Kairi's, but could easily miss if the timing is off. Use it wisely. Find your center and get into a flowing rhythm of evading and exploding. If you can master the mechanics, Murasaki is insanely satisfying, mixing the mayhem and the tranquil music in a beautiful dissonant clash. Failure means death, swift and painful. Don't look at where the bullets in front of you go: plan for where the explosions will happen afterwards. There is a long and tragic story within Murasaki: each successful (and even unsuccessful) chapter unlocks new information, history, bios and even musical tracks. To truly understand the full game, you must become an expert with both Kairi AND Satsuki. It's daunting, it's hard, but the satisfaction of a full unlock is unmatched. Config You can start a config tool from 'Launch Configuration Tool' when you start the game. Here, you can configure the screen size, BGM/SE ratio, key bindings, etc. The death of an empire. The rise of darkness. And two heroes alone combat a broken soul.","['English', 'Japanese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/header.jpg?t=1578972607,http://katatema.main.jp/mu/,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,48,0,,Katatema,PLAYISM,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie","Action,Indie,Bullet Hell,Shoot 'Em Up,Anime,Great Soundtrack,Puzzle,Singleplayer,Arcade,2D,Casual,Female Protagonist,Difficult,Fantasy,Controller,Retro,Atmospheric,Colorful,Experimental,Cute","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_4115d58f8cc9da6c994cab98521befed122d0118.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_285723e0ac3ed606a80f42215f7dc2729de3058e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_403dbdfb1fd4dc8c04b4ef9bd04ff3b20eecfc68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c92a966fb2f34bebefafcf328657ae4aa0ce265e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_37412d3ee0e9b2bd10b0113f6be42778f40199c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_c7e0d85a7b1624ff9bead15a154ba9d45db55ec6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_42b64c0fd9cacdbc4aa84ce821cd7a0c5e5105f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_d007163a143881a64465a68f319e44ed509f635e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/392030/ss_fbec3bd2fcceadefa58f491ddecc3e2a97fa5f77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1578972607","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256662903/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316502,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256660464/movie_max.mp4?t=1461316516"

Here, time passes slowly like a huge wave; people and nature exist together in eternal harmony and prosperity. Beings living here discovered a miraculous power, which was, at first, small, and then grew large enough to move the world. The power transformed into 'mana,' a force that could only be handled by a chosen few, to whom it was entrusted. It has been used properly and passed down from generation to generation; now, after several millennia, the power has become common and natural, a convenient form of witchcraft. However, some things have been forgotten over the long period of peace. An immense and dangerous power. The temptation of the dark side that even sees destruction as worthwhile, depending on how the power is used.

1684220,SEDOMAIRI / せどまいり,"Aug 1, 2021",4.99,"“Sedo” is the world between living and dead. If you want to get back alive, catch all the straw figures. Howver, you must not be found by the children of the Angel of Death. SEDOMAIRI is a first-person action horror game where you escape from a randomly generated world that looks like an old Japanese house. You have a radio. The radio enables you to detect the distance and direction of enemies and figures. Use the radio to collect all the straw figures while hiding from the enemy, the children of the Angel of Death, and try to get back alive from the 'Sedo'. Gameplay built for fear The distance of the player's lights, the distance of footsteps, the distance of the enemy's vision, and the distance at which the radio can detect the enemy are all calculated and set to make you fearful. This ensures that you will always have the fear that they might be right there. Randomly generated maps This game generates maps with more randomness than my previous game, 'Infection Maze'. Therefore, you can enjoy fresh play even after repeating the game. In addition, a custom mode is included. You can customize the size of the map, the number of enemies, and other aspects of the gameplay by yourself. Battery management for items The items the player has are a light and a radio. Both are essential for exploring the map, but they have batteries that need to be recharged within a certain period of time. It makes you feel tense. The atmosphere of a Japanese house 30 years ago I created this art model with the atmosphere of a Japanese house 30 years ago in mind, which only a Japanese author can create.

Mobius, ruler of all dimensions, has gone mad with power and is sending an army to destroy the Aether!  You must vanquish their evil minions by shifting between the very fabric of reality and using their one weakness against them - cold hard steel.  As an Aether Guardian, Jhin can use her 'Aether Slip' to tackle the unseen menace that is assaulting the Aether and save everyone from Mobius's wrath. ​ Features: - Fast-paced, challenging gameplay with tight, responsive controls - Swap between dimensions at will - 9 Different Arenas to Test Your Skills - 6 Unique Guardians to Play As  ( and 1 Secret Character ) - Two Intense Bossfights - Competitive Online Highscores for Each Arena - Moon Launchers ( They Shoot Moons at You! ) - 20 Insanely Hard Challenges - Over 70 unlockable Cheat Codes Controller Support (Xbox, Xbox One, PS3, PS4, GameCube) *may work with off-brand, but no guarantee Local Splitscreen Multiplayer     - 14 Multiplayer Arenas    - Co-Op, Head To Head, King of the Hill, Rifts, and Hot Potato Game Modes    - Custom Match Settings, Powerups, etc Singleplayer: In Aether Drift, you must survive for as long as possible in one of 9 Arenas. Waves of Mobius's soldiers will constantly attack you, so you must do your best to defeat them! The difficulty ramps up over time, up to ludicrous amounts at Max Level. Multiplayer: There are also 6 multiplayer modes that can be played with 2 - 4 players. Co-Op has players competing for highscore in the singleplayer arenas. Unlike singleplayer, this mode lets players revive their fallen comrades. Stock and Timed Modes pit players against each other in a battle to the death in one of 14 multiplayer Arenas. Rifts makes players search across the Arenas for capture points which they must fight for control over. King of the Hill spawns one Rift in the center of the map, and players must fight for control over it. Hot Potato mode places a Potato on the first player hit, which can pass to others by hitting them. After a predetermined time the potato detonates, killing all nearby players in a spuddy explosion. Last one standing wins. ** This game is LOCAL only! ** Additional Content: The game features 20 challenges, each of which will test your skills and agility. Beating them unlocks cheat codes for the game, which can be used to modify both singleplayer and multiplayer to a hilarious degree. NOTE: This game works best on DESKTOPS!

227160,Kinetic Void,"Nov 21, 2014",19.99,"About Kinetic Void Kinetic Void is a 3D space adventure with a focus on customization and exploration. The shipyard allows players to construct their ship piece by piece. Ships can be as simplistic as a cockpit, a hull, a engine and a gun, or as complex as a player wants. Each module has available subsystems which can be applied to strengthen specific attributes of the ship, and when damaged, those subsystems may be destroyed. While in space flight, interactions between objects are governed by the physics engine. Running into an asteroid at high speed will damage your ship, potentially with catastrophic effects. Using the Kinetic Field Generator (KFG) in game will allow your ship to create an artificial gravity around the ship, both protecting the ship as well as allowing your ship to fly freely through space. This field will also enable the Micro Warp Drive, catapulting your ship far into space in a matter of seconds. Kinetic Void is a procedurally generated adventure, there is no main story line. The decisions and direction is left up to the player. Ally with factions, go to war, build your ship and amass wealth, the choices are yours. A New Galaxy Every Time. Procedural galaxy creation allows as many new experiences as you'd like. When a new game is started, the galaxy map, contents of each sector, and the factions involved will be generated from scratch. You may continue to play this galaxy, or if you'd like to try something different, create a brand new galaxy. Don't worry, your old galaxy will be saved in its current state if you ever wish to return. Choose how many sectors you'd like in your galaxy, as well as how many factions (NPCs) and whether your ships will be Creative or Career mode. Know Your Neighbors. In Kinetic Void the galaxy is a living, breathing thing. Not all factions get along, not all of them hate each other. As factions interact, agreements and treaties will be made and broken. Trade, combat and piracy will affect how the factions see each other based on their own internal standings. Fully Detailed and customizable Space Ships. Tailor your ship for any role. Make a sleek fighter, a bulky freighter, or a mighty carrier. Your ship’s capabilities and appearance are completely up to you. Using Kinetic Void’s ship builder you can make exactly the ship you want. Customize every part of your ship from cockpits, hulls, engines, weapons, and aesthetic modules. Each module has its own statistics that affect the total performance of your ship. Every module can be further customized by adding subsystems (right click on a module to add subsystems). You can even color your ship exactly how you want. Each module has seven color fields allowing you to make amazing ships quickly, and easily. Once your ship is created, save it to your computer, or share it to the Steam Workshop for the world to see. Subscribed ships from the workshop have a random chance of making it into any new galaxy as a faction vessel. Freedom to Choose Your Fate. Be the scourge of the galaxy, or its savior. A life of combat and struggle not your thing? Become an intergalactic trader and influence the galaxy one deal at a time. Not interested in being a ‘good guy’? Take on a life of piracy and plunder your way through sectors, creating havoc wherever you go, then docking at pirate stations for supplies as needed. Intense Active Combat. Target enemy ships and maneuver in real time to align devastating broad-sides or crippling strafing runs. Deploy drones to do your dirty work or simply confuse the enemy into targeting them instead of you while you deal with the enemy vessel. In Kinetic Void, your skills as a pilot are just as important as the components that make up your ship. Take Direct Control Of Your Ship. Kinetic Void offers three control modes. In cursor-mode, the player can control the ship through keyboard commands, and pan the camera with the mouse in any direction for quick tactical overview; or Mouse Flight-mode, allowing direct control of the ship through mouse movements.

There's a wide range of difficulty levels so you can start simple then build your skill to experience the full depth of the game. Destroy Enemy Space Stations Command two groups of ships to attack and destroy enemy space stations. With a bit of practice you'll quickly learn where to place each ship, when to attack what turret and how to counter their abilities, the hard part is mastering it. Only the enemy turrets have abilities so you must be extra focused on using your units as a team and their positioning. Dodge projectiles the best you can and when you make a mistake move a ship to safety and another one in to take some hits. Just Get to the Exit! Navigate through different randomly setup star maps to get to the exit and win. They have fixed layouts but the rewards and exit point are in randomized locations. Some rewards will help you and some will harm you. The better you think, plan and understand what to do the more prepared you will be.

1011320,Whiskey & Zombies: The Great Southern Zombie Escape,"Nov 25, 2020",9.99,"WHISKEY &amp; ZOMBIES is a fun and intense brawler with a fair amount of stealther strategy involved as you need to try and escape a very different zombie apocalypse. Turns out that only whiskey moonshine kills the virus so you need to stay drunk while you brawl, drink, sneak, scavenge, and rage your way through the Deep South. But the more you drink — the harder the game gets. The survival of the human race now rests on the last southern family who knows how to make the whiskey moonshine — the McCrearys — a bunch of permadrunk, bootlegging rednecks who all dislike each other. They must now get home to the Louisiana swampland and their illegal moonshine still — to save humanity. There will be comedy and action mixed together with suspense and nail-biting moments that could easily turn into a screaming, button-mashing frenzy. You can play solo or grab some friends and create some whiskey-fueled zombie-mayhem together in local multiplayer . And if someone turns zombie, all it takes is a bottle of whiskey to bring them back. Features __________________________________________________ Top-Down Mayhem: Swig, slug, swing, and shoot your way through the hordes of undead just waiting to take a bite out of your thinking-noodle. Unique Drunk System: You gotta stay drunk to stay alive but the “safer” you are, the harder the game gets. Too drunk and you can’t shoot for shit and you might even pass out. Not drunk enough and the virus creeps up, impacting your stamina and, of course, might turn you into a zombie. Different Characters &amp; Abilities: Play as one of the 4 McCrearys, each with very different and unique traits. Some are slow and powerful while others are light and fast but can’t hold their whiskey very well. Story-Driven: Discover the McCrearys’ Southern roots and their individual motivations as you help them on their way through the ass-end of Louisiana to their home in the Bayou. Fun but Challenging: It might be easy to sneak around and rack up a few kills, but the more you progress — the more resistance you will meet.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/header.jpg?t=1647272931,http://www.whiskeyandzombies.com,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,36,0,,Nuttery Entertainment,Nuttery Entertainment,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Remote Play Together","Action,Indie,Strategy","Beat 'em up,Top-Down Shooter,Shoot 'Em Up,Hack and Slash,PvP,Stealth,Fighting,Survival,Strategy,Top-Down,Action,Zombies,Local Co-Op,Singleplayer,Multiplayer,Local Multiplayer,Co-op,4 Player Local,Indie,Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_267825ca0a6963fc3cbf7c1de025fbfc48e09cab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_f30022cd41ec038882489e181838122ba903e5c9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_2185a1470dd663807e7442d62e9ac9d44be468fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_d99580113ce2c3051750fe438c630552b42dcb08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_eb05fc0c56c54473235101b7f4ef4aa94223bfcf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_ac4f719f2cfad4dc4676cb10a966acbb9ebc5416.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_2dd38a718dae95f4af7be1fda7c8426ffb30a2d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_085b84c31e07933cfbc5f9a785267e5cbaff2364.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_8f65b7dbb4cc97d93c0dbebab4dbebfa3d9a3ef5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_7b26dc268f2827491ceb7c1cb916d13089adcc6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_8c759281a0124a376ff74c9c1e7dcecc2312bf00.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1011320/ss_200277c1dac1556b539422c6d316cba0a613f786.1920x1080.jpg?t=1647272931","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256877773/movie_max.mp4?t=1647272257,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256804348/movie_max.mp4?t=1647272265"

Journey from planet to planet, each procedurally generated with unique environments, challenges, and alien creatures. Explore Scout out the richest resources and the deadliest critters, and discover unique challenges and powerful artifacts. Extract You're going to need all the Ore and Crystal you can carry if you're going to mount a successful defense or purchase the upgrades you'll need to make it home alive. Excape Err... Escape. The resources on each planet won't last forever, but the alien creatures willing to bite your legs off never seem to end, eventually overwhelming even the most stalwart crew. Hold out as long as you can... but don't throw your resources - or the lives of your crew - away to a lost cause. Always be prepared to make a timely exit when things start getting hairy. Key Features Permadeath - If your crew does get eaten by aliens, or your ship is destroyed, that's game over. Procedurally generated - Each play through presents you with a uniquely generated region of space full of new planets, each with different benefits and risks. Pick up and play - Sure there are hordes of creatures out to get you, but From Orbit is still accessible to a broad range of players, even if you don't have much experience with RTS games, or find the complexity of mainstream RTS's off-putting. Set your own pace: rush headlong into danger, or set up your defenses and fortify your position. Planetary Environments - Arid deserts, frigid ice worlds, or lush forests... each with unique challenges and obstacles, and each complete with their own set of hostile critters. From Desert Beetles to Ice Worms, every type of creature you encounter has its own strengths and weaknesses that you'll need to adapt to in order to survive. Equipped with a powerful Omnisuit , any crew member can switch roles at a moment's notice ensuring you've always got the right tools for the job. Harvester The reason we're out here on the space frontier in the first place... resources!

Defender Stand on the front line, keeping your crewmates safe with your force shield and blaster. Clear the path to resources so your Harvesters can go to work. Engineer Construct automated harvesters, turrets, and other mechanical devices. Repair your constructions... or your ship. Nobody's going home if your way off the planet is destroyed.

1342790,GangV | VR & PC Battle Royale,"Apr 16, 2021",10.49,"GangV is a Battle Royale taking place in a living environment featuring traffic, crowds, and law enforcement! Why is this a big deal? Because it changes everything! More Than Your Regular Shooter You start with your own vehicle on a wild starting block with your online opponents and you must be the last one to survive. GangV has a strong emphasis on high-speed chases in the middle of the traffic featuring many different cars but also planes, boats, and helicopters! The game will require your shooter skills as well as your pilot skills for you to be victorious! But be careful, you start with just a gun and your own car may be quickly spotted by your opponents! Steal Your Loot You’ll have to Steal money and equipment from civilians that will call law enforcement on you. The businesses you rob will not only bring you money but also become part of your gang’s territory. This turf war has a huge impact on the Battle Royale as it allows you to put pressure on your rivals, especially at the end of the game as businesses allow you to buy medicine and ammunition. Fight and Run Away From Law Enforcement Depending on your previous actions (heists, murders, …), you’ll have to fight policemen, SWAT, or militaries but you can’t keep on the fight against them forever, you will have to run away and hide from them to focus again on killing your opponents. Hide In the Crowd There is nothing differentiating you from a civilian. That means you can hide in the crowd and in the traffic to find and take your opponents by surprise. But be careful as any civilian could also be a player hiding!

572330,The Fan,"May 10, 2017",5.99,"The Fan is an interactive photo fiction with real locations and actors. Follow the story of 'The Fan', a serial killer abducting women to fulfill his dark fantasies. His latest catch lies in his basement but she's not ready yet. Everything needs to be perfect for the ritual, when he'll show her 'True love'. The fan is a first person exploration game with a unique twist. Driven by a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, it will take you deep within the darkest places of Paris underground. Gameplay The Fan is entirely made with photos . It has a classic 'point and click' feel, using only left and right click but it's closer to the recent Telltale Game series than to traditional adventures games. There are no painful mini-games or artificially inserted sliding puzzles as it is more about discovery and choices. Find out more about the Killer and his victims as the story unfolds and you may be the one to ultimately decide their fate. WARNING : The game isn't rated yet but I wouldn't recommend if if you're under 16, due to the themes and some violent sequences. More About Me My name is Cyril and I'm a Frenchie indie game dev. The Fan is my first released game ever =) The game was created using Unity Personal Edition and mostly Lightroom for the pictures. I started the project in 2012 and did all the shootings, which was really fun, but when it came to actually 'make a game', well, it took much more time, effort, tutorials, training and hard work than I expected :D Although The Fan is a pretty short experience (there are no overly twisted puzzles to keep you from going fast if you wanna rush it), it took thousands of pictures and a tremendous amount of work to make it look good enough. So please, tell me what you think!

1732210,Tile Runner,"Sep 28, 2021",0,"Tile Runner, A 3D parkour game. 10 Levels, with increasing difficulty. Can you beat all 10? Good Luck !!!!!!!! Notes: If your mouse doesn't work when playing, try changing the sensitivity in the options. This game was made by me and my twin brother, and we are now seniors in high school. I had a lot of fun making this game, and I hope you have fun playing it :D 10/28: I noticed a lot of people have been saying the difficulty curve between levels is too high, so to make it easier, I will give hints for each level below. Level 1: Pretty Straightforward Level 2: If you are struggling at the jumps toward the end of the level (where it starts to get narrow), hug the inside walls to take the shortest path to the next platform. At the end of the level, the last jump is an option between left and right, MAKE SURE TO GO LEFT. Level 3: The dropper is introduced in this level, where you maneuver the character in order to make it into the opening below. In the dropper at the end of the level, try to go through the edges of the holes instead of the center in order to be able to get through the following holes. Level 4: Relatively straightforward, but you have to strafe a lot in the air, as well as do 360's. Try to get used to the movement mechanics. Level 5: The first jump is pretty difficult, so be precise in jump timing and movement in the air. After this jump, turn right immediately and look down to get to the next platform. Remember to strafe in the air if you feel you are jumping too far. Level 6: Path gets pretty narrow from here, so if your sensitivity isn't already high, increase it so that you are able to change direction quickly. Level 7: Strafing in the air is important to maneuver through the opening. Move very precisely during the 3rd jump to reach the next platform. During the 5th and 6th jump, look back at where you jumped from while in the air to see where to go. Near the end of the level, there is a large platform where you are able to move freely. After this point, go to the next jump area, hug the wall and start hugging the other side of the wall you just jumped over. Keep doing this. Level 8: Be very quick and precise in movements. Near the end of the level, there is a large room. Hug the large chunks of wall in front of you during jumps. Level 9: In the beginning of the level, do a 180 in the air and try to get above the initial spawn room. The level is extremely narrow and it is hard to react to new obstacles, so try to memorize them as you die so you know where to go beforehand. Level 10: Pretty straightforward where to go, but very difficult. If you have any more questions about where to go or what to do, put it in the reviews/discussions and I'll try to answer them.

841830,Semi-Sweet Tofu,"May 3, 2018",0,Semi-Sweet Tofu is a 2D side scrolling platformer game where players have to eat fruit to survive along with using the color you change while eating the fruit to defeat the enemies you are faced with. We took things from other games and modified them such as “Don’t Starve” when you have to eat to survive and added another mechanic too that he fruit you eat to survive also give buffs to the player as well as useful to survive and progress. You have to jump on platforms and use certain fruit such as the apple which gives you a higher jump height to reach certain platforms or the banana fruit which gives you movement speed so you can jump further or run away from the magician. The core of the gameplay relies on the fruit and the ability to use them in a unique way. You can throw fruit at enemies to stun them as well as collide with them to destroy them. If you’re not the same color as the enemy you’ll take damage but if you are the same color you’ll destroy the enemy without taking damage.,['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/header.jpg?t=1525379683,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,Team TatoTaco,"Ottercopter Studios, LLC","Single-player,Full controller support","Adventure,Casual,Indie","Adventure,Indie,Casual","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_6fc291ff55f7fb1fa348579a705bf999de75382b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_1dc832d4e0b218ed436a0c1faa7c4fab0b657840.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_50fb62dc6a402c048bf1ec35f4100553066bb932.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_796a31cb8955473b94b10d683433a8cbbf645f10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/841830/ss_df50c2e30efdd1577280fe9e7c2c3652d34848a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1525379683",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256713429/movie_max.mp4?t=1522979943

The Leprechaun and all his leprechaun friends have laid siege to Calico City using their clover-based-magic. Do you have what it takes to save Calico City from the leprechaun menace? What if I tossed in purring kittens? Features: 100+ handmade puzzles ranging from easy to hardcore.

Each theme introduces new characters, traps, and tools like the teleporter device and a coin operated hammer for building things. 40 Achievements Game Save System Boss battles. Developer Commentary: Last year I began learning how to program, it was something I had always wanted to do. I used the Twine Interactive Fiction Engine to experiment and learn. I started off with simple tests, which eventually evolved into large games: A train game, where you were stuck on a train and you could shovel coal and drink tea and look out the window at the random scenery selected for that day. It was quite zen. I also created a game based on Edgar Alan Poe's, 'The Raven.' It was an educational game that sought to take a really long poem and dissect it with comics, gifs, and mini-games. People liked it, and I had a fun time dressing up ravens in various costumes for it. Those games were more art than game according to the community. That was a fair opinion, the mechanics were as limited as my knowledge. I wasn't satisfied to just create art though. I wanted to make a game that was unmistakably a game. I set a goal, I was going to make a 100+ level game with maps and mechanics and puzzles. I wasn't going to take a whole decade either, I made an effort to work on it every day, even if I was tired so that I could someday finish it. At first I didn't even know how to make a map. Then I discovered arrays and how to use them. It was magical seeing my character walk around on the map I put together. I spent all day at work coming up with theories as to how I could implement the various features I wanted to put in the game. Errors. Errors. Constant errors. I'd spend all day just trying to get one thing to work. My determination paid off and the mechanics I kept hammering at started to work. Usually at that point they were clunky and flawed. I'd end up completely re-doing them, but I didn't mind, every error was a chance to learn better techniques. I hope that the love put into the game makes it all the more enjoyable to play.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/header.jpg?t=1528811675,https://gamejolt.com/@spess,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,40,0,,Midnight Warden,Superfantastic Productions,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Includes level editor","Adventure,Casual,Indie","Casual,Indie,Adventure,Puzzle,Singleplayer,Comedy,Great Soundtrack,2D,Pixel Graphics,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_0e41758d68b6f583fa6eb8966202bc8a6835c8e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_1d9bcf28194173e6f9987b109b2c4547be449771.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_98fd49328a45d89bf92ca07368b764349aef7b8e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_4235e877773b5cb3d6c1722022a9669f1750d238.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_1a277b6e852163a9103b53f02e1b50520513e62b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/846220/ss_a18331883a214259fa51da60bfbd676b866f8718.1920x1080.jpg?t=1528811675",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256717973/movie_max.mp4?t=1527607142

You step into the shoes of a hapless professional driver tasked with transporting various alcoholic beverages such as beer, spirits, wine and brandy to certain venues like birthdays and other miscellaneous celebrations. If you thought this mission will be easy, think again. The infrastructure will be challenging to say the least. Country roads, mountains and highways that resemble dirt roads will all prove to be worthy adversaries on your path towards a successful delivery. Abysmal roads aside, the biggest enemy will be your very own addiction to the booze you’re transporting. Potholes seem harmless after you’ve transformed into an insatiable drunkard which suddenly thinks that he’s got the off-road skills to take as many shortcuts as needed. The most inaccessible corners of the map no longer seem like obstacles. Really, what are YOU waiting for? Rev that engine, empty a couple of bottles and put your own skills to the test in a parody that absolutely does not encourage drunk driving in real life. Stick to video games and that hangover will disappear faster than flipping the wheels in this simulation! Key features : -          Unique gameplay featuring eight levels with deserts, forests, rural roads and highways. -          Three camera modes. -          Four booze types as the main commodity and foe. -          The high probability of experiencing drunk vision. -          Challenging driving highlighted by obstacles and time limits.","['English', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Traditional Chinese']",“醉汉视角的赛车游戏？Steam最近上线了一款非常魔性的独立搞笑游戏《醉驾模拟器》（《Need for Spirit: Drink &amp; Drive Simulator》），玩家扮演一名憨厚的货车司机师傅，游戏中最大的障碍是你浓郁的醉意[吐]，” 电玩巴士 - 520k followers on weibo - Alexa Rank - 20(global) “《醉驾模拟器》登陆Steam 深刻感悟醉驾带来的危害” GamerSky - Alexa Rank - 470(global) “DRIVING DRUNK?

926140,CHANGE: A Homeless Survival Experience,"May 1, 2020",14.99,"CHANGE is an emotional homeless survival experience set in a randomly generated city with rogue-like elements. Explore, survive, earn perks, find items and kindness to develop your character and escape to a new life. With hundreds of perks, items, events and more, this serious game comes with a large amount of depth that opens up the more you play, and changes based on how you play. 20% of Delve Interactive's profits from this game will be donated to charities focused on the issue of homelessness. This is a hate letter to the growing indifference in the world. When members of the development team almost fell into homelessness some years ago, it inspired us to create something that gives a voice to the forgotten and the vulnerable. We take the subject very seriously and portray it as such. After over 7 years of research and hard work, 100s of updates and fan support, we bring you our tale of survival and isolation. Choose from 5 different characters each with their own background stories and maladies, then create your own story Find companions and find kindness. Build a reputation or even friendships with various characters including the other homeless and the police Build your inventory with food, survival tools, clothing and more... as well as unlocking new items for your next playthrough as you progress Spend a night in police stations, parks or shelters, spend time at bars, visit the clinic, study in the library, recycle scrap and more as you discover new areas and buildings Learn about the lives of the homeless and everything they go through to survive, with every part of the truth having been heavily researched by the developers Experience a beautifully composed emotional soundtrack Manage your hunger, hygiene, happiness, crime levels, street reputation, study levels and other stats as you try to survive and escape the homeless life. But you can only do so much in one day... what will you do? Will you spend the day begging, depending on the kindness of others? Will you find shelter in the night? Perhaps you're moved out of the area by the police for loitering. Unable to find shelter, you end up on the streets at night, and you meet a dog. Is it a stray? Could it be a friend? All your actions affect your happiness in some way, and it's up to you to manage your stats accordingly. You could turn to drink, but risk addiction. You could hope for a fortunate event, or make some progress towards your survival. But you will have to choose. It could all be over if a bad event occurs in the dangerous night streets. Especially during winter. Every game is different, and with each playthrough comes more ways to explore CHANGE. If you became homeless... what would you do? PLANS Our goal with this project is to raise awareness on the issue of homelessness, as well as raise money for it. We have done a ton of research for this project and while our wish is to portray the reality of homelessness, various aspects of sleeping rough have been abstracted for the sake of gameplay. So far, we've raised over £7000 for the charities CRISIS, The Clocktower Sanctuary and Shelter. Join us in the community section to discuss the game with the team! We're always listening and awaiting your feedback.","['English', 'German', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Spanish - Spain']","“With this rich, emotional overlay, coupled with some deep, appealing mechanics, CHANGE is an enthralling survival experience from start to finish.” New Game Network “Change is a gritty, hand-crafted, labor of love that transcends its simple, pixilated aesthetic.

I know I did.” CyberPowerPC “PREVIEW: ...the game says a bit more, a bit more deeply, about being homeless.

929570,A Familiar Fairytale Dyslexic Text Based Adventure,"Nov 18, 2019",0.99,"This game was created to help others feel the frustration of having dyslexia. You play as a small fox a fairytale story with Kings, Queens, and witches. This game is a text-based adventure created with the intention of allowing the user to experience the frustration of being dyslexic. Sentences and words are made intentionally hard to read through different rules of how they are constructed change with every chapter, ranging from a flickering background, jittery letters and PQBS's being swapped around. Choices must be made in a quick time which leads to even more frustration. Much like a book, you could skip to the end of this game thought the chapter select menu but this is supposed to simulate the fact that you can do this but don't get any satisfaction from doing so. You can re-read chapters to see if you can get a better outcome. There are a bunch of options to try to make the game easier to play based on people's common conceptions on what fixes dyslexia. There is an option to add a colored overlay and remove the flicker in an attempt to combat 'Scotopic Sensitivity Syndrome/ Irlen Syndrome'. And there is an option to change the font to Open Dyslexic which in my opinion is harder to read. There are options which allow you to play the game in non-dyslexic mode if you want, but wheres the fun in that. The game includes a range of accessibility settings.

1213420,Texas Holdem Poker: Solo King,"Mar 4, 2020",12.99,"The game consists of two parts: 1: In the console game section, you can play tournament games and heads-up games against professional-level AI opponents. 2: A complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation tools The table below shows the functional price comparison between the computing tools in the game and other Texas-related computing products on the market. Help players solve two problems: 1: Have a complete tool chain: You have purchased a complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation-related tools at a very cheap price, and it calculates correctly and runs stably. It is cheap, comprehensive, and convenient. One account can share data on multiple platforms, and the functions are consistent, and there is no castration. 2: Learn the playing strategies of professional poker players: You only play games with professional-level AI and learn the playing strategies of professional poker players. There is no random behavior to confuse you with entertaining AI, and I don't want to waste your time. Satisfy player pursuit and advancement: 1: When players play Texas Hold'em, they just want to find and master a set of playing strategies that suit their profession. The professional AI I wrote is written in accordance with the standard textbook-style playing strategies of professional poker players, and they are all in standard poker scenarios. fixed action paradigm, It is very fixed, not random, which helps you quickly understand the playing strategies of professional players. to learn this strategy. Your discovery and learning of patterns will not be interfered with by random strategies. Don't think it's going to be silly, it plays a lot better than most players in online real money games. You can buy it on steam to try its AI capabilities, if you are not satisfied, you will get an unconditional refund within 2 hours, you have nothing to lose at all. This AI uses standard and mature textbook play to fight against you. You can learn the AI's play, understand the AI's play, and find your own way of defeating the AI. It all depends on your own understanding and ability. The AI ​​is not responsible for providing you with the thrill of victory, it is up to you to win. The more games you play in the world of online real money gaming, the more severely you feel you are bound, you feel right, you are almost all playing with a group of professional players who rely on a full suite of scientific tools to give real-time calculations and decision-making cues playing. It was people who were heavily armed like me. In fact, the AI ​​strategy in this game basically covers all my action strategy logic. I wrote it to greatly reduce the energy consumption of my decision-making in the poker game. The strategies in this game are extremely effective at PokerStars blind levels below $10/$20. Further up, I don't want to play games with too much stake, so I can't stand up effectively, so I don't level up. 2): You have learned strategies, and you need a complete set of tools to assist you. Without scientific calculation tools, in real money poker games, you have strategies and dare not use them. The essence of Texas Hold'em is a real mathematical probability game. Data and calculations determine the choice of strategies. In the past two years, the Texas Hold'em books handwritten by foreign professional players who have been translated by the player groups on Taobao are very expensive, far more expensive than my game. Those books cost hundreds of yuan, and they are still very popular. This marks that although the state strictly prohibits Texas games, players' pursuit of strategic knowledge has not stopped. They provided some foreign poker experience and strategies, and I provided a professional training ground and toolset that also filled the gaps for the Chinese in terms of Texas science tools. 3): Optics does not practice, it is natural to learn, and it is valuable to apply what you have learned. You don’t know whether you are cheating or not, and you don’t know why you win or lose. Basically, you are just playing for nothing. In this game, you can freely organize the table, freely set the blind level, freely set the hand range of each opponent, freely set the opponent's AI type, and freely set your own hand range, so that every time the card is dealt, the You're dealt hands in this range, and you're also free to set one of the 20 good hands, so there's a definite training. In the game, the various win rate data, listening win rate, and EV data of each player on each street are calculated in real time, saving you the trouble of manual calculation, and also giving you AI decision-making suggestions from professional-level textbooks. These ensure that you can train fully on demand. and judging whether it makes sense for you. The complete display of this information in the game also helps you analyze the game, so that you know the logic of your winning and losing, where you win and where you lose. Don't think that you lost, it was me who cheated, you can understand whether I cheated by reading the data and graphs carefully, you can't understand these, either you have no knowledge of technology and playing cards, or your understanding is too poor, what? It's all clear, you still can't understand it, and it's clear that you don't have the ability to think, and you can't play IQ games, so don't waste time torturing yourself. Tell you clearly: 1: I sell strategies and tools, and I show you professional strategies in the game. 2: The game is sold at a fixed price. Even if you lose all the chips and diamonds, the server will continue to supply chips and diamonds for you to play. There will be no extra charge. I don't need to cheat you for chips and diamonds at all. , I don't even bother with it. 3: The chips and diamonds provided are enough for you to play 50000 hands. You need about 500 hours to play them all. For the vast majority of players, they will not spend 500 hours on a certain game. They do not give you a huge amount. The chips and diamonds are also to bring you closer to the real world to play from small stacks, so that it makes sense. 4: It is not a multiplayer online crowd gambling game, but a console game, or more precisely, a training tool. The networking function ensures that you can freely share usage data between your mobile phone and computer. This game is more precisely a training tool and a tool for assisting actual combat calculation and strategy. I have provided you with a trainer aircraft and a fighter jet, and it is up to you to combine your wisdom, ability and financial resources to control and use it to assist you. If you think you want to train yourself and experience the brutality of professional gambling, then you can play hard. It provides you with the basic prerequisite knowledge, skill-strategy mix, training environment and toolsets you need from beginner to pro. As a poker tool, the existing functions have completely covered the calculation and decision-making functions of the whole process and all stages required for scientific training and real-time battles. At least it's completely enough for me. There is no longer any free on mobile: 1: Before the V4 version, a free google play version was provided for the convenience of steam players to download the mobile version for free, and for some users who were unwilling to pay to experience the function for free. The new version of V4 will be forced to upgrade from the beginning, and the old mobile phone version will not be able to log in. Old users who pay for it need to ask me for it. 2: Now I don't offer any free versions on all platforms. Now the computer and mobile phones have the same functions, and the google play also has the same price on steam. But you only need to buy the steam version, then you can send me a letter to ask for the corresponding android mobile version. When asking for the android version, you need to provide a screenshot of your purchase history on the steam platform to prove it. Just send me a screenshot of the purchase record information in the email. 3: All versions are unified as paid versions, and the price is the same, which ensures the rights and interests of paying players and the quality level of players. 4: On February 26, 2022, the new version of the server was updated to Alibaba Cloud, with 4 cores of 8G, 10M dedicated bandwidth, 80G cloud disk, and a 3-year lease, so the service for at least the next three years is guaranteed. If you are a streamer and have some fans, you are willing to play it, and willing to share and show this game to your fans, I am willing to provide you with some steam keys. Send me a letter with your platform and number of followers hits: In the battle mode, the range of each player is also shown to you graphically, and the player's hole cards are in the corresponding range. In the pc version, you can select a large resolution in the setting function, so that you can see the range map well in the game. And the most important thing is that it's the cheapest of its kind. manual： We welcome capable agent wholesalers from all over the world to sell the software, I provide retail steam keys in all regions of the world 100~500 steam keys, 30% off 500~1000 steam keys, 40% off 1000~2000 steam keys, 50% off The larger the wholesale quantity, the better the discount {LINK REMOVED} core function: 1: Click the function board card to set the community card, and click the hole card icon to set the hole card. 2: Different player types can be set, and each player has a different range of actions. These ranges also determine different action logics. 3: Equity calculator, draw equity calculator, EV calculator, real-time poker simulator tool. 4: Real-time poker simulator tool, this is the most important for online professional players, which greatly simplifies the time consumption of thinking and performing calculations. 5: Advisor (advisor) provides you with a standard play, the basic guarantee is not to lose money. 6: Before the action decision, provide the EV value of different actions and betsize. 7: Practice the advisor and action EV in the battle mode. Core value points: 1: Poker simulator tool: When playing poker online, professional players can display the complete mathematical data immediately after entering the opponent's range in real time according to the situation of the game table, saving users calculation time and energy, and providing standardized behavior suggestions. These real-time and accurate calculation data and standardized action suggestions help players make quick decisions. Value point: It saves the player's energy consumption in mathematical calculations in the game, and allows the player to invest more energy to focus on the accurate determination of the player's playing range and the use of real-time data to make decisions based on experience. Real-time display of all poker game data, which is not available in other tools. I combined the various data calculation functions scattered in multiple Texas poker calculation software into the real game. The player only needs to determine the opponent's range. In the simulator, Preflop and postflop are also purchased professional range action data, which can be set in the simulator: stacks deep, bet size, and player position to see the real-time advisor. Now this advisor is conservative. range data comes from rangeconverter.com/solution_formats/eight_max-MTT-Complete-Postflop-Addon-NEWOnlineViewer-yearly The core of the simulator is that you need to have the ability to judge the opponent's range of action. This is also one of the most basic and most important abilities of playing cards. If you don’t have the ability to display the range of Texas Hold'em at all, then you can use this tool to repeatedly play poker to familiarize yourself with the range. In the battle mode I provide the ability to display the range in real time. Let you clearly see how different people in different ranges play, and those actions are standard textbook play styles for professional players. Real-time display of complete data: The data standard provided comes from the result of 10,000 times Equity calculated by Monte Carlo method. In the battle mode with AI, you need to turn on the observer mode switch (observer) Data in the avatar frame: 1): EV: 0.70BB, indicating the EV data after the current operation. BB stands for the big blind value. 2): equity data for each street: 2r: 4; 12.93%. Format: 2r (to river equity, calculated to river street Equity): rank (in the current surviving players, own 2r Equity ranked); equity (own real-time 2r Equity, 2r Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the Equity data to River Street is calculated based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. nd: 1; 72.67%. Format: nd (next street equity, your own Equity on the next street): rank (ranked your own nd Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time nd Equity, nd Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the nd Equity data to the next street is calculated according to the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. cp: 1; 88.23%. cp (current street pure equity, the pure Equity of one's current street): rank (ranked of one's own cp Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time cp Equity, cp Equity calculated from your own perspective). Represents the calculated cp Equity data on the current street based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. Outs: 30, which indicates the number of draws made by players on that street. At this time, you can open the hands card strength information table, and you can see the probability of the current hole cards and board cards developing to various draws on each street. 1: In preflop and river street, showing 2r is enough. 2: On flop, turn street: displays the complete 2r, nd, cp data, and on flop, turn street, you can see the outs data of the player in that street at the same time. These real-time Equitys and draw data assist in determining the hole cards against other players' hole cards or ranges, their own hands card strength and winning ability, and help them make action decisions on various streets. The betsize window at the top of the interface shows the human player (self) under the current action menu, the EV value ranking of each action in the action menu, the leftmost is the best, and it decreases from left to right (if there is only the leftmost data, then it is According to EV evaluation, this action is the most appropriate, and other actions do not need to be considered). This is based on the action logic shown by the EV. This is also the EV data of each action calculated by the player himself before the action. (The EV data in the avatar range is the EV data after the action, and the meaning of the two is different). This 4-speed EV table of betsize is the data display for making decisions based on EV when displaying the street. In fact, EV has no absolute correct meaning in action guidance before and after the flop (preflop and postflop), and it is not correct to make decisions based on the positive and negative EV. Advisor (Advisor): Shows the decision in this street, comprehensively assessing the following content: player's hole cards, opponents' range or hole cards, current own 2r, nd, cp Equity data and Equity ranked, and the player's own position Table position, player's current stacks deep, current number of people remaining at the table, EV data of each action in the current menu, and bankroll management. The current advisors tend to be conservative, and the goal is to try not to lose money. Advisor also implements a standardized pre-flop strategy in preflop. Advisor also implemented the post-flop strategy suggested by rangeconverter.com in postflop. In the battle against AI mode, you need to turn on the advisor mode switch (observer). Click on the user's avatar to open the user's scope, view or set the scope. Click on the hole cards, you can open to view or set the hole cards. Click on the board card, you can open to view or set the board card. In the simulator, click the D icon to switch the position of the dealer. Click the gray D icon to reset the position of the dealer. Regarding range setting or selection: 1: Provides the standard range for various filling actions in the preflop stage. 2: Provide 24 kinds of action ranges commonly used by professional players. Each professional player divides all hole card combinations into 10 action groups. You can see the action ranges of tag, lag, rock, maniac, and nit players. 3: Provides a view of the opponent's mathematical action range based on the opponent's vpip and pfr. Vpip and pfr can view these two values ​​of opponents from third-party statistical software licensed online, such as holdem manager 2. The graphical Equity calculator provides a complete and correct Equity calculation function. I provide complete toflop, toturn, toriver's montecarlo and Enum calculation methods. It has the same effect as Power-Equilab, and its own data is guaranteed to be correct. When Power-Equilab calculates toflop and toturn, the data is often incorrect (why it is not, you will know by playing with his montecarlo and Enum methods, the longer the calculation, the greater the deviation of the two data, which is wrong), But the calculation result of to river is correct. It sells for $40/year. It does not have a real-time calculation method in the game. It is not suitable for actual combat, but only for review calculations, lacking actual combat significance. PokerGenius: This provides draw data, and my draw ability calculation is the same as his. This one is from the University of Alberta in Canada, which is also one of the two most famous schools in the world that studies AI in Texas, and the other is cmu. It also provides equity calculations, but only with toriver capabilities. Moreover, neither the draw calculation nor the Equity calculation has the ability of real-time calculation in actual combat. You can only manually enter the calculation to see the result in the review. It sells for $70. The provided Equity calculator, draw calculator, and EV calculator are all to ensure that you know the correctness of the data calculation results and allow you to trust the correctness and stability of the function. The AI ​​in the battle mode comes from the range of 24 professional players. You can conduct targeted range confrontation strategy training. 1): Various AIs and advisors use the same standard professional gameplay action logic. The difference from yours is only the hole cards and the action range. 2): 14 types of chip depths (10BB~100BB, 200BB) are provided (different medals will open different new chip depths, and different chip depths will have different playing methods). Because of the different chip depths, the card game will be played The strategy is completely different. 3): AI adopts the textbook style of professional players. You can understand the AI's action logic in thousands of matches, you can learn this action logic, and you can also find the corresponding exploiting AI logic. Repeated training can help you quickly identify the opponent's ability and the opponent's range. The functions of this V4 version basically cover the core functions in Snowie. As for the effect, you just need to compare it. I can only tell you the value for money. Ability matching is equivalent to Snowie 230 USD/year.

1418160,Happy Quest,"Nov 6, 2020",1.99,"Happy Quest is a casual match-3 game. You are a kind hunter in the town. Your quest is help beautiful girls to defeat monsters. Let's make the girl feeling happy. Yayyyy !!!!!!! CHARACTERS Rena is a sweet funny girl that is serious when it comes down to business. She is pretty short, but despite that, nothing scares her and she can talk back to anyone. The girl only teases the people that mean something to her and that's what happens with the protagonist too. She has a great business and is one of the best talents regarding potions, but never brags about it. The girl knows that people don't take her seriously because of her looks, but she managed to show them how imposing she is by her hard work. Sana is a elf warrior but that's not what her whole personality revolves around. Despite her stern look, she is a person that values life more than anything and thinks it is better to retreat sometimes from fights and try again than to die a hero. She is a smart, strong woman that has some love for humans and other people, despite them being against her kind. She knows Rena and that helps her trust the mc more since he came from her. Georgia is a strong woman, both physically and mentally. She leads a bunch of men in her blacksmith shop and doesn't respond to anyone. She is a very important person and the best in the town, making weapons and armors for the king and people close to him. She lost a close friend in a battle but doesn't tell anyone about it. Since then, she swore to not participate anymore in these sorts of things. Although she makes items that kill people, she doesn't see all battles as something that should never exist but more like a necessary evil. Angami is a strong but weird naga warrior. She has to watch over the MC but despite that being an inconvenience for her, she barely complains about it. She has to train the recruits all over the kingdom and despite her tough look, she loves to joke around and tease, especially with people close to her. The woman is older than the mc by twelve years but no one else knows that about her. She started this by helping Georgia, but warmed up to the protagonist and even bring him food from her place. Yuna is a cheeky succubus that only hunts the best guys in the town. Despite her sexy attitude, she is overwhelmed by the MC's kindness and falls in love for the first time in her long life. She is made to attract people so that was never a problem for her, so she can't explain how the protagonist managed to refuse her advances in the first night. She is almost never serious, but gets interested in what humans do and even cooks for the mc as a gesture of gratitude.

1986310,猎魔战纪,"May 25, 2022",0,先声明本游戏战斗有一定难度，并不适合喜欢玩挂机刷刷刷的朋友。 由于并没有太多的测试人员，主要是我自己在测试，即便我玩了很多遍，但难免会有遗漏和不合理的地方。 如果有出现BUG或者大家觉得有某些地方难度不合理，希望大家能积极反馈，评论区留言或者进群@都行！感谢各位赏脸游玩！ 游戏着有不同于其他回合制游戏的战斗机制，每个角色有着独特且能产生质变的天赋加点，你可以把角色按你想的方向上培养。 但是注意你的天赋需要与你主要使用的技能搭配，才能发挥最大效果。 本游戏需要注意的点： 1.很多技能释放需要tp点，我们可以通过加攻速或者加tp回复来提高tp获取效率。 2.技能每次使用会获得熟练度，熟练度可以提升技能等级和伤害，技能熟练度达到要求会解锁更高级技能，所以我们要尽可能多的使用技能，把一个技能练到极致会比每个技能练一会要强得多！ 3.游戏的里控制技能对任何敌人都有效，但部分怪物被控制后会狂暴，狂暴状态下将免疫控制且伤害可能会略微提高。 4.按Q可以快捷保存。 5.设置里面有设置战斗加速，修改窗口样式等功能。 6.更换装备时镶嵌物品会自动转移到新装备上，不需要自己取下来重新镶嵌。 关于战斗： 与其他回合制战斗不同，游戏中有攻速属性。 攻速直接影响角色普通攻击造成伤害的次数，而普通攻击每次造成伤害恢复5点TP，物理系技能是没有冷却时间的只受TP点数的限制，所以攻速也间接的影响了技能的释放频率。 对于敏捷路线的角色，想要提升输出，提升敏捷和攻速是最佳方式。（前提是你的攻击不能太低） 对于力量和智力路线的角色，攻速带来的提升并不明显，所以TP恢复至关重要。很多时候直接增加伤害不如增加TP恢复来的实在！ 关于美术： 刚开始是有想请画师和美工的打算，可是了解了下价格我放弃了…… 整个游戏包括角色立绘、行走图、怪物图片、场景图块、技能特效、UI设计然后一堆图标感觉没个十来万下不来，这让我实在承受不住。 后来想找人已合作的方式给分成，但似乎也不现实，毕竟想找人来免费玩你的游戏都挺困难的…… 所以，只能咬咬牙自己瞎折腾了。游戏的UI素材大部分是RPG make和dlc自带的，也使用了部分其他资源，费劲力气也只能整成现在这样了！ 关于剧情： 作为一个rpg游戏剧情至关重要，但是很遗憾…… 我个人觉得游戏的剧情框架还是不错的，但是受限于自己的文笔和图片素材不足，很多剧情其实都是根据现有图片素材临时编的。 其实游戏中有很多东西没有讲，比如： 1.关于水斗的来历，其实佐克和水斗的父母其实曾经也是猎魔者，后来水斗父母意外死亡，于是佐克退隐照顾主角。 2.夜瞳的父亲其实是十几年前的被星玄打败的将军，整个军队全部战死无一生还。由于莫名其妙的被人团灭，他从受人尊敬的将军变成笑柄，夜瞳和母亲也饱受其他人的嘲笑，夜瞳的母亲也因此郁郁而终，所以长大后夜瞳来到帕拉斯是想弄清楚当年的事，为父亲正名。 3.乌诺斯为啥要打帕拉斯？其实是有人拱火，这个人和故事的幕后黑手麦迪文一样其实都来自的另一个大陆。他们就是想两边拱火，让两国打起来，他们就可以乘机进行实验，制造战斗用的魔物，说白了就是想把这片大陆当成战争实验室。 4.其实后续还有剧情，大致内容是：两国还是打起来了，之后再与夜瞳再见面，却不得不兵戎相见。然后会有新角色出现，阻止了战斗，新角色是另一个大陆的人，他正在调查他们那个大陆的一个邪恶组织，而这场战争就是这个邪恶组织在幕后操纵，目的是乘乱制造出可控制的魔物…… 其实整个剧情有点参考了一部日本动漫《大剑》，这是一部被禁的神作（个人觉得是神作！），至今我的电脑里还有这部动漫的资源，想看的可以加群@我，哈哈哈…… 后续： 虽然这个游戏还有后续剧情，但是暂时不打算出续作，因为我觉得自己目前还没有力能把剩下的故事讲好…… 也许等哪一天时机成熟了，我会回来继续填这个坑，也许…… 之后还是会接着做新的游戏，目前有一些思路，大致是一个策略经营+战棋的游戏。 新游戏的话打算用unity去做，也会花钱去请美工画师，有新进度我也会在群里通知大家，希望大家到时能关注一下。 游戏qq群：634019932 作者b站主页： 头条和西瓜视频：,['Simplified Chinese'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/header.jpg?t=1653818726,,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,21,0,,水狗工作室,水狗工作室,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Free to Play,Indie,RPG",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_71debbd8b2ef0220362d2457c7d436a757452416.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_a55f7799378a715f1a09d0f1865b54f5cf331542.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_6e6dae23ecff4709935a9f7af04ae2043893b4ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_212e0e0e54a3fb01bad00b29ce0742fa9a3a3823.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_5eee828bfaf061ec4aab893177b8517b2f43c421.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_274c26ce4b9d0b6ca184ae25f398f135e1872df5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1986310/ss_74317dd7bf08e20a494b4e2981993df2950b862b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653818726","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888059/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369874,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888060/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369878,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256885323/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369883,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256885321/movie_max.mp4?t=1653369887"

After all, she feels positively sane – and her talking plush bunny Harvey absolutely agrees. Together they try to make their escape and meet the weirdest inmates – from a man in a bee costume to the pseudo-siamese twins Hoti and Moti. But Dr. Marcel, the head of the sanatorium, does everything in his power to stop Edna from leaving. What is his endgame? And why has her memory been wiped?

Anchorhead is a text adventure game in the style of classic Infocom games from the 1980s. No graphics, no menus, no point-and-click — you navigate a written story using typed commands, and read what happens next. Travel to the haunted coastal town of Anchorhead, Massachusetts and uncover the roots of a horrific conspiracy inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. Search through musty archives and tomes of esoteric lore; dodge hostile townsfolk; combat a generation-spanning evil that threatens your family and the entire world. A sprawling, meticulously detailed setting, brought to life by finely crafted prose and illustrated with dozens of spine-chilling illustrations, ensures that the story will stay with you long after you finish playing the game. A sullen belch emanates from the clouds, and the rain starts coming down harder — fat, cold drops smacking loudly against the cobblestones.

454330,A Room Beyond,"Jun 13, 2017",7.99,"A ROOM BEYOND, is fantasy point and click adventure based on essential subjects of human existence. This novel game draws the drama around the “Fog Wanderer”, a murderous apparition scaring a small village in a Lovecraftian world. Help the villagers to solve the murder mystery and discover your own fate which seems to be oddly woven into the entire drama. A philosophical story is built upon inspiration coming from the book The Top Five Regrets of the Dying . Videogames such as Alone in the Dark 1 , The Last Door and the famous Lucas Arts games significantly influenced the general tone and coloring of the game, as well as the art of H.P. Lovecraft and E.A. Poe . The game’s innovative mix of pixelart and low-poly rendering has attracted a lot of interest among players and artists. Synopsis When you awake, you find yourself trapped in a gloomy cave. Dim candle light reveals strange symbols and cult objects all over this place. You can’t remember what happened, but this place gives you shivers. There is a tiny ray of light in the distance which might lead to a room beyond this darkness. Outside the cave you find yourself in a forest which is surrounded by deep gorges and thick layers of fog. A crowd of people lives here in fear of an ominous apparition that creeps through the fog for manhunt. Help the villagers to solve the mystery of the murderous fog wanderer and uncover the fate that brings you to this place. Gameplay Simplified control of the game can be learned fast and allows a quick start. No strong prior experiences with computer games are needed for playing A Room Beyond. All interactions can be accomplished by clicking or dragging the mouse pointer. The game does not define specific timing so that players can take their time to explore the virtual world. Additonal game features are unlocked gradually while progressing storyline. Technology &amp; Style 2.5D Perspective: The game’s visual perspective is known as 2.5D, which describes a combination of 3D effects in a general 2D stage design. Both types bring their own benefits to the game: Interaction and navigation is easy in a 2D scenery, but visual perception of depth is increased by using 3D objects. Pixel Style: Manual and procedural processing steps create a mosaic-like pixel effect which results in a graphical abstraction that increases the scope of visual interpretation and stimulates players’ imagination. Combination of both, smooth animations brought by modern technology and the look and feel of retro pixel game design leads to a fresh contemporary graphic style.","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain']","“Excellent cliff-hangers.

Immerse yourself in the ambient atmosphere and otherworldly music for a soothing experience. Search for lost artifacts hidden throughout the world in order to unlock the final secret of Mare. REVIEWS Upload VR: Winner of 2021 Upload Awards - Hidden Gem. Mare is a breathless beauty of a VR game – simplistic in its progression perhaps but never anything less than astonishing to take in. The VR Grid: It’s not about the destination, but the journey as they say, and Mare is one helluva journey. From the opening moments of the game, all the way to it’s conclusion, I was enamored by the presentation and the story. Mare is nothing short of breathtaking and a welcome change of pace to the to action-packed, fast-paced titles I have been playing of late. Its a strikingly beautiful yet solemn adventure that pushes you ever forward toward the unknown. 6DOF Reviews: Mare is a title I can easily recommend to anybody who has an appreciation for beauty and mystery. It evokes a mood unlike any I’ve experienced in VR.. It may be brief, but its impact will far outlive its duration, proving beyond a doubt that it’s the quality of our experiences that matter, and not their duration. Mare is a class act from start to finish. It's a macabre and mysterious adventure that offers a haunting experience that long outlives its light puzzles and relatively brief playtime. VR Focus: A puzzle experience with beautiful scenery and a mysterious plotline all about a girl who needs your help. The barren environment coupled with the superb musical score ensures Mare has an ambience and soul few VR projects achieve.","['English', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'German']",“A Breathless Beauty Of A VR Game” 4/5 – Upload VR “Mare is a class act from start to finish.

Go on stealth missions, run alien blockades, and investigate mysterious planets, 'aided' by Lloyd, your insufferably obnoxious shipboard computer. Choice of the Star Captain is the hilarious interactive science-fiction novel where your choices determine how the story proceeds. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. For example, suppose Lloyd has just informed you that your ship will crash land on the jungle moon of Cygnus Delta in 93 seconds. What will you do? A) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moon’s gravity well. B) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he’s so smart. C) Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moon’s surface instead of attempting a risky escape. D) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloyd’s screen with a torque wrench. Humanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero? Will you uncover the secret that sparked the Blob invasion? Will you serve as ambassador and convince the Blobs to spare the human race?

552350,Unhappy Ever After,"Jan 20, 2017",0.99,"'In the infinitesimal spaces between the pages of every book lies an unseen universe: smaller perhaps than ours but filled with all the wonders, and horrors, conceivable by the human mind' Enter into a land of dark fantasy with Sophia, an eighteenth-century librarian's apprentice to Queen Anne of England. Join her quest to find a way home and help her take revenge on the evil witch that tore her away from her lands. Discover a world filled with political intrigue as a power-hungry Emperor seeks to wrestle control of the Twelve Duchies by use of his magical Affinity Guards , and get caught up in a rebellion where Sophia's abilities will help decide the fate of the strange, monster-filled world into which she's been swept. Venture with her into steampunk, technomage lairs abandoned since the mythical 'Age of Words'. Share her descent into The Purple, a strange and disturbing underworld where everything lusts for flesh. Help her explore a dark forests under the curse of an Evil Blight and discover the reasons behind it. Help her make new friends in a dangerous world, and share in her first unlikely, romance. Aid her in her discovery of an ancient, magical curse that lies over the world, denying all it's inhabitants the ability to read. Take control of ancient magical texts that, as she discovers them, will allow her to develop abilities strong enough to challenge the Emperor's most powerful Affinity Guards , and perhaps even the terrible witch who is responsible for tearing her away from her home. About: ‘Unhappy Ever After’ is a dark, yet funny, RPG that takes traditional fairy tales and turns them on their heads. Along your journey you will meet familiar characters that you’ve know all your life and see them in new situations and within frameworks that you will make you both laugh and despair. Beyond its parody to the fantasy, ‘Unhappy Ever After’ also aims to parody the real, drawing on situations that are all too pervasive in our world, such as drug abuse, terrorism, and dirty politics.

Command Your Team: Just like Dragonfall, Shadowrun: Hong Kong features a crew of flawed, dangerous runners with backstories that could only be possible in the tech-meets-magic Shadowrun setting. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems.

1023420,四国志でらっくす ～酒池肉うどん戦記～,"Jul 31, 2020",24.99,※对于中文版本，搜索“四国志 ～酒池肉面战记～” ※中国語版は「四国志 ～酒池肉面战记～」で検索してください。 _________________________________ 諸君の目的は……。 四国を制圧し、ヒロインといっしょに観光したり、グルメを満喫しまくる事である! さあ、四国の覇者となり、いざ豪遊せよ! ■ストーリー 物語の舞台は、地域分権が進み、各県が独立国となった四国。 主役は香川県の知事「浦島次郎」と副知事「女木鬼姫」。 二人は香川県の財政破綻を回避するため、そして観光し放題、グルメ食べ放題目指して、四国統一に邁進する! ■ゲームシステム 地域制圧型シミュレーションならぬ、'地方'制圧型シミュレーション。 歩兵や戦車といった現代的な軍隊を率いて戦うが、あくまでここは四国。 経済力は貧弱だし、食料自給率も足りていない。重要な発電所は特定のエリアに偏っている。 このような状況下、敵の動向も考慮しつつ、内政と軍拡を行い、四国統一を目指す。 ■ヒロインと四国を満喫！ ヒロインと一緒に観光したり、特産品を味わって親睦を深めよう。 藍染体験、カツオ漁、柑橘食べ比べといった、四国ならではのイベントが超大盛り! ■方言効果で可愛さ100000倍! 各県のヒロインは方言っ子。 シナリオが進んで仲良くならないと、方言を使わないキャラもいたりする。 特殊な表現にはルビを振っているので、県外の人にも安心だ。 ■豪華なグラフィック イラストレイター「天音蓮人」さん書き下ろしのイラストを採用。 さらには300枚近い四国の写真が物語を彩る。 ■究極の四国ゲー 本作を作るにあたっては、４年にわたる取材を行った。 作中に登場する29もの自治体への現地取材、方言監修者からの情報提供。 さらには総務省、農林水産省、資源エネルギー庁、経済産業省などが公表している統計データも収集した。 その成果は余すことなくゲームに反映されている。 観光やグルメ、ヒロインとのイチャラブはもとより、戦略、産業、地理に関わるイベントも充実。 浦島伝説、鬼ヶ島伝説、空海伝説など、四国に伝わる伝承もストーリーに取り入れている。 ■作風まとめ 全体的に明るいラブコメ調。そして観光やグルメ要素は、空前絶後。 一方でSLG部分は硬派。 ハードモードでは、手強い財政難と敵AIが待ち構えている。難易度を下げれば、気軽に四国を満喫できる。 ■注意事項 ～注意1～ このゲームは、重度の飯テロゲーである。 四国各地のローカルグルメが、これでもかというぐらい映し出される。 夜中に遊ぶ時は、うどんの準備を忘れないように! ～注意2～ このゲームを遊ぶと、たぶん四国に行きたくなる。 旅費がかかっても知りません。 ～注意3～ 一応このゲームはフィクションだ。正確な観光情報は自分で確認しよう。,['Japanese'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/header.jpg?t=1598108398,https://wargame.jp/?page_id=1913,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,Flying Panjandrum / ふらいんぐパンジャンドラム,Flying Panjandrum / ふらいんぐパンジャンドラム,Single-player,"Adventure,Indie,Simulation,Strategy","Adventure,Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Anime,Turn-Based","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_2e3903d698b21fb7c5f8338f284051ffcfd15af4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_f58bd31e43be3530bd253a44af3366a6b487a5ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_ab1f5635318e77c8938621fd51c8c6e3a2005e51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_42ad79722d84d52693bf2248576c179be8a15bf2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_2acbfd8b0e817c10ff3d26c8ccc385e38bcc82b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_bfeb23623109e3125856faee093861f073799984.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_adafdc9de9e2cd3d10e4f5300c91cb0e1646fa93.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_8da874564a6497a98c0cb395402d30244c641c81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_1ae4f397c79e307ae3a29e6ece37e68a8fa84f94.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_0445c77eec8265b5243eca6ad9e642d4087c8123.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_6014b4eb4c8dae3558c948d17c428358821975e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_1527a61c254eccd4d7f8377adb5d57943c551a05.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_e4eff60c8f64ab4f0046fbcab6ecd3cfe909f211.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_b14b28378a5156150f0afb02f76a50e0114005aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_305a3e2ee9febfcff0ce1d8a72fd6f76b4986d88.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1023420/ss_2a68c2fb95cbe1b0d0ca66a72bf6e2e51a76c51d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1598108398",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256791302/movie_max.mp4?t=1593593495

She has to recover her lost momories to discover her past and find out what happend to her. Istoria is a game about strategy and Character Customisation. You will be able to change and combine Classes and change Items ( Weapons, Artifacts and consumable Items ) for all playable Characters, to fit your strategy to overcome your foes. The Game also features many Side and Challenge Missions to unlock more customization choices, like BluePrints with let you craft new/different Items. Turn-Based Strategy: Combat is Turn-Based and seperates in to stages, the Planning Phase and the Combat Phase . Planning Phase: Unlike in 'most' Turn-based Strategy Games, you have to plan more than just on 'action/attack'. This means each turn you have to plan multiple 'actions/attacks“ for each of your Units should make that turn, before you enter the Combat Phase. Units/Characters can make more than one action/attack each turn which can make a turn quite complex/difficult to plan. Combat Phase: If you are finished/satisfied with you Planning Phase you will end your turn starting the Combat Phase. During the combat Phase you have no way to change you desisions and all Units/Characters will take turns to activate and use 'actions/attacks“ until all activations are resolved and the next turn start. Customize your Characters: Every playable Character can spent upto 10 level in upto 4 Classes (you can mix/combine Classes to suit your strategy). Classes can have a level beween 0 and 5, unlocking Skills and/or Passives with each level. Every Character can equip atleast one Weapon, two consumable Items and one Artifacts. While completing Missions/the Story you will also be able to choose between rewards to permanently alter/enthance your Characters. Example Character: For this example we will take a look at the Character Elysa , who is a Water Spirit that joins the party in Chapter 1. After joining the party Elysa can use 4 Classes (as the game progresses she can/will unlock more) . For this build we want to make her a support character . First we will spende 8 Classlevel (Chapter 2) , 5 in the Enhancer Class and 3 in the Cleric Class . This will unlock these Skills (black) and Passives (grey) . For the Weapon we equip [Tome: Chilling Storm] which grants her the [Chilling Storm] Skill without using the Hydromancer Class. As an Artefact we will use [Unholy Arsenal] with has a passive that grants 2 additional Skillslots, with is a perfect for a support Character with many support Skills. As consumable Item we equipen a [Mana Potion] and [Ironskin Potion] (to increase her weak physical defence) . For the last step we have to choose with Skill we want to equip on her Skillslots. Every Character can choose upto 5 Skills, but thanks to the [Unholy Arsenal] (Artifact) we can equip 7 Skills (8 if we count the Weapon Skill) . Our Skill choices are: [Holy Smite] a basic holy attack spell. [Divine Plea] a holy healing spell. [Purge] a spell to remove magical effects. [Imbue Power] a buff spell that increases damage done. [Dome of Protection] a buff spell that increases defences. [Magic Cocoon] a buff spell that reduces damage take to 0 for one turn. [Undying Stamina] a buff spell that increases actionpoint regeneration. [Chilling Storm] a cold spell that deals damage and slows enemy units. And the Passives are: [Equality] Elysas Character Passive that can incresse the effect of Attack, Buff and Healing Skills, but only after using a Skill of the other type. [Mana Discharge] the Spirit Race Passive, this will restore mana (party) if this unit dies. [Radiant Faith] incresses healing. [Enhanced Spirit] incresses mana regeneration. [Lingering Power] incresses buff/debuff durations.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1251270/header.jpg?t=1658323323,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,May feature veiled Nudity.

Master and summon 15 different spirits with unique abilities. 15+ hours of story and gameplay. SUMMARY In a regional city in the present day, Sayaka Mimuro manages her family's Shinto shrine on behalf of her absent parents. Along with her childhood friend Haru and a talking furball (rabbit?) god, she lives a peaceful life, but when an earthquake strikes, aggressive spirits suddenly appear and her world is torn apart. Sayaka receives divine tidings that the only one who can save the city is herself—she's actually an Onmyoji with the power to vanquish spirits! However, in order to unlock her powers, she must first perform certain rituals with a man... '...If I'm the only one who can do it, then I guess I have no choice!' Sayaka is bewildered to say the least, but her natural sense of justice gives her the resolve to fight... 'There is only one person I can ask to do this and that's you, Haru... Please?' With no one else to turn to, Sayaka asks a confused Haru to be the male partner she needs for her rituals. With his help, Sayaka finally unlocks her battle-princess powers to wage war on the spirits that ravage her city... CHARACTER Heroine: Sayaka Mimuro Voice: Yui Sakakibara “Nothing is impossible if you give it your all.” A hardworking and beautiful girl with a strong sense of justice. Although Sayaka herself doesn't know it, she's descended from a line of Onmyoji sorcerers, and the powers of exorcism slumber within her. She was brought up to be responsible, and she'll never abandon anyone in need. She also tries to see the best in every situation—even the bad one that her dutiful nature has gotten her into now. When it comes to love, she has as much of an interest as anyone else, but the shrine work she does in her parents' stead has always kept her too busy to date.

304970,SolidFace Parametric CAD Modeler 2D/3D,"Dec 22, 2014",0,"Part module SolidFace Sketch automatically creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and fully integrated with the 3D module. SolidFace allows multiple bodies creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from a single part file. The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context or top-down part creation. To facilitate the assembly process, the part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components. Drawing module Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically created and aligned with the base view. Another advantage of the automatic link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features operations like extrude, revolve, etc. Exploded view An exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements. The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation. 3D Direct modeling Interact directly with the geometry of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting. Keeping the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the new faces. 2D/3D Movement simulation One of the many capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation.

WHAT CURATORS SAY OFEN™: “Интересный движок по воспроизведению анимированных обоев на рабочем столе.Поглощает мало ресурсов компьютера.” (Translate: “An interesting engine for playing animated desktop wallpapers. It absorbs few computer resources.”) Hookups: “A fun little piece of software that will transform your desktop wallpaper into something that feels more alive! Lots of options in this software! Great cheap price for something so enjoyable! ” 5 minutes of game: 'XWallpaper - это забавный и мощный движок для живых обоев, который отображает удивительные анимации и эффекты на ваших обоях с низкой загрузкой процессора.” (Translate: 'XWallpaper is a fun and powerful live wallpaper engine that displays amazing animations and effects on your low CPU wallpaper. ”) 爱の鉴赏家： ”推陈出新，她真的非常棒！初看到的时候我是有些不以为然的。因为动态壁纸领域，早有Wallpaper Engine作为领头老大哥，很多后起之秀，只不过都是模仿之作，而且其中大多数不过个赚个噱头，质量远远不如前者。可是当我实际用起这款软件，体验简直太棒了！如果非要说Wallpaper Engine有什么缺点，那就是能自由自在下到很多壁纸和壁纸素材，可是仅限于使用，玩家自己的可控性却很低。但是这个新秀，明显有意改善前辈的不足。她不仅仅可以对动态壁纸加入了大量的可控要素，甚至可以说将一些做图软件最实用的功能全都简化之后，再搬进来。在这款软件里，大佬固然可以大展身手，但是新丁也能够获得极佳的动态壁纸制作体验。另外，这款软件还主打一个新功能，就是支持鼠标的单独特效。正如软件介绍中写道：提供数百款漂浮粒子特效(200+)、滤镜特效(20+)、鼠标拖尾轨迹特效(200+)、鼠标点击交互特效(200+)，实则不虚。仅仅是简单的编辑，无论是壁纸还是鼠标点击，瞬间就酷炫了很多。如果想让你的桌面靓丽起来，如果想获得比Wallpaper Engine更好的自由度，这款XWallpaper或许能够成为你电脑桌面的超新星宠儿。“ 小熊饼干: '前所未有，真的，这个软件真的很厉害，Wallpaper Engine这个大家都知道，应该算是动态壁纸的标杆了，但对我来说它只是一个单纯提供别人制作的壁纸的软件，我很羡慕创意工坊里那些大神们制作的令人眼花缭乱的壁纸，美是很美，漂亮是漂亮，但缺少了某些东西，这些东西只有我自己懂，该如何做，当然是自己做一份满足自己的壁纸，但是，很难，对我来说太难了，我连业余都算不上，那些繁琐复杂的制作步骤让我望而却步。但是，xwallpaper能满足我 ，我相信，因为这种傻瓜式制作步骤简直是为我而生。 爱不释手啊爱不释手，轻便，对比Wallpaper Engine更低的cpu占用率，满足了对动态壁纸没有更高要求的人群，当然也满足了像我一样lj配置的爱好者，我不知道steam上还有没有其他的壁纸编辑软件，但这款，是真的打动了我。' 17173萤火虫： “一款UI精简清爽的动态壁纸软件，支持创意工坊，功能较丰富，玩家不仅能够找到适合自己的静态或动态壁纸，还可根据需要对图片进行单独的可视化设计，包括添加飘浮粒子，增加滤镜效果，甚至是改变鼠标的点击跟轨迹特效功能。既不占空间也不占内存，总的来说挺实用。。。。' 汉化语录: '《酷鱼动态壁纸》是最近由开发兼发行商XWidgetSoft发布的一款可编辑的动态桌面壁纸软件，使用者可以直接从软件的创意工坊查看动态壁纸的预览并下载，但它最大的优点是，使用者可以根据自己的喜好使用软件内置的各种视觉特效工具来把一张图片变成一个全新的动态壁纸，实现无穷多的可能性，并且产生的动态壁纸还可以直接上传到到创意工坊，软件在使用过程中CPU占用不多。。。' Blacklist_: “这是一款和《Wallpaper Engine》同类的桌面壁纸软件，不过内容上与ui都非常精简，支持创意工坊，壁纸的下载与更换都非常便捷，cpu的占用率也更加的低。但壁纸桌面预览功能个人感觉还不是很完善。 其次，还能够用基础图片自主设计自己的动态壁纸，并可以根据自己的喜好添加特效，鼠标指针的点击，运行轨迹等等也可以设计自己喜欢的特效，支持云，能够上传供其他用户下载。值得尝试的一个软件。”","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/header.jpg?t=1607489848,http://xdesktop.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,128,,XDesktop,XDesktop,"Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor","Animation & Modeling,Design & Illustration,Utilities","Utilities,Design & Illustration,Animation & Modeling","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_b1d3ea368506ed2b572b52a4cd621f9da8a4e15f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_025bb72d196d33192359941d50e193660e5a4905.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fc75e7674c6504cd05ebc2e976c531d0ea7ecb41.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_63814f52104617fd5f68d16c4fd413c4b1b71879.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_7300607954b6ed31a34928f73819544f9cc4138d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_fb5b1c59896c570e5a8b71a4a24acfdd4dc620d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_76d879d21a0f279274aec1fd01d5d64fcfe32e6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ba24ba3fcd7e17b09f271fa37a3d37aa52aece7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_ef6f30cb676e63f06b3fd30bd3014833b5e8efec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_1b451cd8d843c95637e4247f7c7b980862cf7dd8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1093880/ss_56516ca22d95c97a99d7e047423842f8eee09ca9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1607489848","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758665/movie_max.mp4?t=1565795573,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256758342/movie_max.mp4?t=1565100720,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763932/movie_max.mp4?t=1570438319,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256763944/movie_max.mp4?t=1572261239,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760117/movie_max.mp4?t=1566747400,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256757970/movie_max.mp4?t=1567605898,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759660/movie_max.mp4?t=1566699139,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759351/movie_max.mp4?t=1566175333,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256759081/movie_max.mp4?t=1565798208"

677880,Draw Your Game,"Aug 10, 2017",4.99,"“I wish I could make my own video game.” Who among us hasn't thought that at some point? Draw Your Game is a user-friendly application allowing anyone and everyone to create their own video game in a few quick steps: ▶ Draw your game's world on a piece of paper, using four different colors (black, blue, green and red). ▶ Use the 'Draw Your Game' app to take a picture of your drawing. ▶ Wait 10 seconds, while Draw Your Game transforms the drawing into a game. ▶ Play your game, with a character that you can control. ▶ Share your creation with other Draw Your Game users. Four different colors to create the world of your choosing: ▶ Black for stationary floors/ground; ▶ Blue for movable objects that the character can push around; ▶ Green for elements that the character will bounce off of; ▶ Red for objects that will destroy the character or the blue objects. Draw Your Game allows you to create an infinite number of worlds, either on the same sheet of paper or by adding new sheets, one after the other, to create a real story line. There are two available modes: ▶ “Create” mode, to create your own worlds; ▶ “Play” mode, to play in the worlds created by the community, either in “campaign” mode (worlds selected by our team), or in “catalogue” mode, where you can use search criteria to choose a world yourself. There are several ways to play the different worlds, at the creator's choice: ▶ “Escape”: the character must find a way off the paper to escape and win the game; ▶ “Destruction”: the character must push blue objects into red ones to destroy them. Our teams approve each new world before releasing it to the community, and a rating system is used to rank the top worlds against one another. [] ▶ Use fairly wide felt-tip pens. ▶ Choose vivid colors. ▶ Take pictures under good lighting.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/header.jpg?t=1502354684,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,43,0,,Zero One,Zero One,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support",Casual,"Casual,Platformer,Hand-drawn","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_1678380950ebac84202055083b6203c8e8e0163e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_2c500bf228b7eb77b417e3a33d923ad2a808f852.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_bff6bdf44b1b291473520cc136afbca3f4d50e51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_d94d37ed784c6f52cb31b795e2c364ed97f45851.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_9b456ef2f86761bc6b63544d272516638efbc09a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_105e22f97a7148e33bd0d6b0791547a3bb58cbed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_caf80ca9da235d21c2f9e9c606aec64a0661dfd7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/677880/ss_99272a04bf3261225ea88048764790614e8abd0f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1502354684",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689941/movie_max.mp4?t=1501794251

This game showcases the revolutionary Freedom Locomotion System that provides you with a wide range of options, which will allow you to find the most immersive fit regardless of how motion sickness sensitive you might be. The Freedom Locomotion System puts CAOTS (Controller Assisted On The Spot) at the front and center of the system. This is a form of walking in place locomotion solution where to move, you simply walk, jog or run on the spot, allowing you to walk, jog or run in VR. This also has the benefit of allowing you to traverse large open world VR spaces in an immersive manner while been less likely to get motion sick than traditional sliding VR locomotion solutions. For those that prefer a less active solution, or are still susceptible to motion sickness even while walking on the spot, the system provides Dash and Blink steps that are derived from teleportation schemes that have been proven effective in not causing motion sickness. Any way you choose, you'll find that you can get around the various large scale environments in an immersive manner that helps you feel as though you were really there.

40420,Tidalis,"Jul 16, 2010",4.99,"Tidalis is a block-based puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new 'streams' mechanic. The game is brimming over with riffs and variants on that core mechanic with 20 game modes, dozens of special blocks and items, and 115 levels in the adventure mode alone. The basic rules of the game are this: blocks fall down into the board and have a color and an arrow direction. If a stack of blocks exceeds the height of the board, you lose. In order to clear blocks, you must right-click and drag paths through the arrows to set up chain reactions of like-colored blocks. If this sounds simple, that's because it is -- you'll be lining up lengthy chains within minutes. But you'll be surprised how much brainpower it takes to set up combos of multiple chains, and the many brainteaser-style puzzles include some real stumpers. Tidalis has co-op and competitive multiplayer modes (both online and offline); action-oriented modes and timer-less brainteasers; a lengthy, casual-friendly adventure mode; twenty unique game modes providing innumerable twists to the basic gameplay; dozens of special blocks and items; and over fifty minutes of beautiful music to go with the painterly art. In short, several games' worth of content are built on top of this core mechanic, which you'll quickly find to be as iconic as it is novel. Key Features: Puzzle game with casual appeal, hardcore depth, and an addictive new mechanic. Two-player co-op and competitive play (both local and networked). A wide selection of both action-oriented or brainteaser-like levels. Casual-friendly adventure mode, hardcore-focused custom games and vs modes. 20+ game styles, and dozens of items and special blocks. Rich, painterly art style and beautiful music. Players can create and share whole new themes, levels, and adventures. Options for colorblind players, players averse to lots of light and motion, and older computers.",['English'],"'Tidalis is a match-3 game that doesn't feel tired or repetitive: I actually want to play it, which says something considering how many puzzle games I've reviewed. I don't think it's a stretch to say that Tidalis is one of the best puzzle game I've ever played. Simply put, if you like puzzle games (and even if you usually don't), you need to get Tidalis. Right now. Go!' James Allen, Out of Eight PC Game Reviews (8/8 score) 'Overall, this is the most robust and interesting casual game I have seen in some time. There is so much to do and so many ways to play I don't even know that casual actually suits it.

If you do the job well, you are rewarded with another block of the same size. However, if you fail to line up the blocks, the part left outside of the underlying block disappears and the next block you get is smaller. The smaller the blocks, the more challenging it is to stack them. Despite its simplicity, MoveUp can get highly engrossing. Each time a piece of your block disappears and the next blocks get smaller, you become more absorbed since you see the end of the game getting closer. Fortunately, you can gradually grow back your blocks by landing several perfect landings in a row. All in all, MoveUp is an excellent choice for some casual VR gaming, especially after a long day.

1165280,Shuffle World,"Oct 9, 2019",0.99,"Shuffle World is a platformer puzzle game where the player makes unreachable areas reachable by shuffle pieces of the level. Like most side-scrolling platform games, you control a character that runs across the screen, jumps, collects and avoid obstacles. Unlike any other platformer I know, you must shuffle the level itself to get all the fruits. This platforming game has a little twist because the level is divided into segments like a puzzle. Each piece can be swapped by another piece. Select two segments to swap them. A segment will be highlighted by a green border if you hover over them. When they are swapping they will exchange their position in the level. The levels come in different kind of sizes and are different cut in segments from each other.

695420,Hex: Origins,"Sep 23, 2017",1.99,"Hex: Origins is a casual puzzle game based on a complete hexagon themed colorful experience. Enjoy a refreshing, calming and original experience, which is extremely easy to pick up but hard to master as you progress in the game. Across the multitude of game modes and levels you will encounter, you must place pieces composed of anywhere from 2 to 10 and more hexagons, each using up to 6 different colors. Everything in the game is based on two simple rules: You can place a piece anywhere on the board with no restrictions as long as all the neighboring tiles are empty. If one hex has a colored neighbor on the board, at least one of those neighbors needs to match its color. Building upon these simple rules, we added special board pieces and power-ups in order to create a fun and colorful experience. As long as you keep placing pieces on the board, its requirements for placing pieces change - so be careful about the order, colors and type of shapes you can use. Always plan ahead! Gameplay Hex: Origins offers you 4 different game modes, 2 available from the start, and 2 unlocked with tokens you earn while playing the game: Classic: a linear experience bundled up in Episodes, structured into 6 Chapters, each containing 6 Levels that you can play in 3 difficulties. Each Episode introduces new mechanics into gameplay and with each passing chapter, the difficulty is slightly raised - but so are the rewards! Flow: a linear experience similar to Classic, with the added requirement of connecting various battery pieces to light bulbs in order to power them up! Carefully plan your colored ways across the board and take up the challenge! Don't forget to fill up the board, though. Exploration: Give up the static board and expand in any direction! Exploration maps feature a center starting point with all the colors onto which you will start expanding in any direction you want. Treasure Hunting: On rare occasions you will find treasure map fragments. Assemble them into a map and embark on a  thematic journey in order to find the hidden treasures of Hex: Origins. Always remember that X marks the spot! Features Over 800 levels of ever-increasing challenges with 3 difficulty options Dynamic level difficulty &amp; no unique solutions: the moves you make always alter the possible shapes that can be placed thus making it easier or harder for yourself. As you place these pieces the game will try to generate pieces that you can use. Plan ahead carefully. Finish a level in any way possible! Shuffle mechanic: discard existing pieces and draw new ones in exchange for a tiny fraction of your progress bar. 5 power-ups that you can use to slightly alter or completely change the game board. Special bonus shapes: from time to time a difficult to place piece will appear (9+ hex piece). Place it on the board and successfully finish the level and earn extra rewards.

With your two hammers, crush the incoming runes in sync with epic viking music. Keep hitting the runes perfectly to accumulate combo energy in your hammers, and you will be able to activate a speed boost! Viking music: The tracklist is curated with love and care. Unleash the drummer in you and play to the epic rock and metal tracks of Alestorm, Gloryhammer, Saltatio Mortis, Wind Rose and many more. All have a festive viking/celtic/pirate style, which will make you feel the viking power in you! Simple gameplay: Following the tradition of arcade games, Ragnarock is easy to play, hard to master. To move forward, only your sense of rhythm matters. However, to win the race, you will have to train and use your skills wisely. Multiple difficulty settings will help you improve over time. Only the most experienced players will be able to collect all the gold medals, beat the high scores and sign their name on the leaderboard! Cross-platform multiplayer mode: The multiplayer PvP mode brings real-time competition against your friends or other people. Start a public or private game (up to 6 players) and beat them all to finish in first place! In solo, you can also race against ghost ships (representing your best score or other players from the leaderboard) to add some competition. Mythological environments: Ragnarock transports you to the land of the vikings in stylized environments inspired by nordic mythology. Support for custom songs: Want to play a track from your personal music library? You can create a custom playable song from any song you own, and play it in solo mode.

283620,World of Subways 3 – London Underground Circle Line,"May 12, 2014",14.99,"World of Subways' is our series of the most interesting Subway and Underground routes of the world for the PC. After the releases of New York and Berlin we are now proud to introduce Vol.3 - London Underground. This simulation covers the entire Circle Line in its current operational service which includes the new section to Hammersmith. This line offers a length of 27km with 35 stations, many hours of fun and interesting missions The Circle Line is an underground service of the London Underground circling the center of London. It was first described as such in 1949 and already appeared on the 1947 Underground Map. It had not been built as a separate line, but was merged from different sections of the Metropolitan Line and the District Line. Only two short sections of this line are solely used by the Circle line. These sections are the connecting curves between the stations of High Street Kensington and Gloucester Road and between Aldgate and Tower Hill. Features 3D - Cockpit with rotatable camera Original virtual reproductions of 35 stations on the Circle Line Free movement in the train and at the stations (accomplished for the first time ever!) More realistic AI trains, dynamic passengers on the platforms Superb graphics, reflecting headlights, night effects Realistic announcements recorded exclusively by the original speaker Tube map Physics The physics have been developed based on real values, such as those used in training simulators. The driving and braking characteristics of the trains are reproduced faithfully and reflect the feeling to actually controlling a train of the London Underground. Graphics Compared to the first two products in this series, Vol. 3 uses a new 3D engine. The simulator is now based on the Vision Engine Trinigy, which made it possible to substantially improve lighting and 3D effects. At the same time the stability and performance of the 3D engine has been improved.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain']","“World of Subways - Volume 3 hebt sich deutlich von seiner Konkurrenz ab und führt derzeit die Simulationen an.” 85% – -subways-3-test-alles-einsteigen-wir-fahren-durch-london.html “World of Subways is a lovingly realistic recreation of the Circle Line of the London Underground, with the amount of detail that has gone into both the stations, and the trains, it sets the bar of train simulators, and is definitely one for the true hardcore sim crowd.

1588760,Switchball HD - Puzzle Platformer,"May 17, 2021",2.69,"Switchball is an inventive and fun puzzle-driven game based on real world physical interactions. Beautiful and elegant 3D graphics offer panoramic views of 30 incredible levels in 5 amazing worlds. The game puts the player in the role of a marble, which is guided through a narrow winding course suspended in mid-air in five different worlds: Skyworld, Iceworld, Caveworld, Cloudworld and Lavaworld. The marble can be morphed into different balls with unique physical properties, like a Marble Ball, a Power Ball (which can be charged and have an accelerated 'dash', a 'jump' ability or switchable 'magnetism' properties), a Steel Ball (which can push heavy objects around), and so forth. Each course contains obstacles and traps, such as wooden blocks, sheets of cloth, spinning fans, magnets, and cannons. The game uses physics-based puzzles as well, such as moving boxes; also, different balls react to the environment in different ways; Steel Balls, for example, will tear cloth platforms. Each level is timed, and players are rewarded with Gold, Silver and Bronze medals, depending on how quickly they complete the level. Switchball has received several awards over the years and is now relaunched on Steam as Switchball HD. Originally called Crazy Ball, the game won 'Best PC Game' during the 2005 Swedish Game Awards and was a finalist in the 'Technical Excellence Class' during the 2006 Independent Games Festival. Switchball also won Team Xbox XBLA Game of the Year in 2007.

There are also glossary and character screens which you can visit at any time. So while it is still recommended that you play the original first, it is not strictly required. Sable's Grimoire is a visual novel series set in a fantasy world filled with magic and monsters. It follows the adventures of Sable, a young human who wants to become a magic researcher, during his time at Amadronia Academy. Sable spends his everyday life at Amadronia surrounded by demi-humans, including elves, pixies, and succubi, as he learns more about this magical world and the creatures within it. As their first year together at Amadronia Academy comes to an end, Lisha and Sable make plans to spend their upcoming break together in her home. An elven village far away from their noisy classmates, where they can enjoy the break in peace, and be alone together at last. What awaits them at their destination, however, is not the holiday they had planned. Their time away is soon spoiled by news of recent kidnappings and graves being robbed. To make matters worse, these crimes are alleged to have been committed by a dark elf. Keen to investigate these incidents, Sable and Lisha move from town to town as they encounter one shocking revelation after another: mind control, forbidden magic, a human town where magic is the norm, and another side to her father's past which Lisha knew nothing about.

This is a known issue with the Unity engine. We recommend picking ONE shift key on either side and then using another key to control the other flipper such as S/L, CTRL or Tab. The entire game's soundtrack currently spans close to two hours, not including all of the sound effects and victory/defeat riffs. Features full controller support, mouse / keyboard support, and the Steam online leaderboards to rank your final score for each table. No subscription, monthly fees, or tickets required to enjoy some good ol' fashion pinball. What do the Steam curators have to say about this title? Check it out!

She was a Franco-Spanish painter and a key figure in the pictorial revival that took place in Europe during the First World War. Her relentless artistic career, her impressive biography as a genius from the time she was a child with physical difficulties, and her extraordinary intelligence made her stand out, especially as a member and only woman of L'école de Paris, a star and an essential figure of Cubism. She became one of the most important characters of the 20th century avant-garde art. This virtual gallery is intended to pay tribute to the great artist on the 90th anniversary of her death in Paris, and to introduce her work and language as a painter and theoretician to the interested public. Her new languages and the most advanced techniques are shown in 65 works never seen before. This museum has several rooms marked by key dates in its history, accompanied by a virtual character who, from a few monitors, explains her biography in a playful and didactic way, corresponding to the works exhibited in each space.

1259000,Damascus,"May 15, 2020",0,"Damascus is set in a post apocalyptic fantasy future where the destruction of the past has knocked society into a medieval state of living. Many creatures have gained sentience in this timeline leading to the rise of frogman, catsons, owlpeople and many other races. Over time humans have developed psychic abilities that they can invoke with the use of mechanical psychic actuators, these psychic abilities allow them to summon fire or teleport to new locations among many other powers. The destruction of this world was caused by Dark Gods of sacrifice known as the Gods of Destruction, the player can sacrifice items to these entities in order to receive powerful boons from them. The apocalypse was thousands of years in the past and many of those living today have very little to no knowledge of the events that transpired or the fact that there even was an apocalypse. Design Goals Our goal is to create a MMO experience that rings true to how classic tabletop Dungeons and Dragons feels with weekly meetups where the dungeon master is creating new custom content for his players taking their decisions and desires into account. We want to have a very active community and will be working very hard to interact directly with the players of the game. We also want to implement new concepts like temporary bosses that drop limited edition items. Controls Left Click to perform the most obvious action on a given tile. Right click to bring out a drop-down menu of all possible actions for a given tile. Tab to show or hide the sidebar. FAQ Here is a little set of common questions about the game in a FAQ format. We thought this would be an easy way to get across a lot of information. How do you guys make money? We sell bonds which grant membership. The bonds are redeemable for 14 days of membership and can be traded with other players if you so desire. This means its feasible to do an in game activity for someone who has already bought a bond and trade them for the bond as payment for the activity as a means to become a member. What is membership? Membership is the full game experience and unlocks access to all of the in game skills and grants access to the entire game world. Money made from membership helps us cover the server costs and really helps us out! Will you ever sell experience or items directly? No we will not. The only thing we will sell are bonds. The value of a bond in game is determined by the players and what they are willing to trade for them. The only way to gain experience or items will be to play the game. We don't believe in selling power. What are your goals in terms of membership? Our biggest goal would be to get 500 monthly members which would allow us to cover all our server costs and both work on the game full time. Any members over this amount would be an absolute blessing! What happens when I die in game? All of your currently equipped and all items in your inventory will be dropped and you will re-spawn in Split City. Will you reimburse my items if I die and lose a lot of them? No we will not, dying in game and losing items is part of the game and it's up to you to bank important items you don't wish to lose. How many towns are there in game? There are 14 towns currently in the game. What happens if I forget my password? As long as you provided your email address when creating your account we can reset your password for you. At a later stage we will facilitate linking your Steam account to your Damascus account which will provide extra security and password retrieval mechanisms. Why aren't you guys doing Early Access? The way we view MMORPG's is that they are inherently a service. Our goal is to constantly update the game as long as it is live. Due to this we didn't want to be yet another permanently in early access game and have decided to have the first stable version of the game be our release version with many updates and future content already in the pipeline. How often will you update the game? We plan to update the game every couple of weeks with new content, however this is a loose timeline and it could be shorter or longer depending on the content we are currently working on. We intend to be very active on Discord so you can always ask us directly about what we are working on and approximately when you can expect the next update. Will you ever expand the world map? Yes we do plan to at some stage release new Islands and Continents which will expand the scope and scale of the game. However these updates will take some time to implement and most likely come with new quests as some of our larger updates to the game. Will I get banned for selling in game items for cash to my friends? No you won't. All in game items earned by you belong to you and you a responsible for them, this means you are free to give them away or sell them to other people and it also means that it's your responsibility to not lose your items in silly ways (like attacking a Damascus Steel Dragon at a low level). Will I get banned for using/creating a third party client? We won't be supporting third party clients and we would consider this a bannable offense. The only version of the client one should use is the Steam version. Will I get banned for macroing or botting? Macros that make the game easier as well as botting are not in the spirit of the game and are considered a bannable offense. We suggest avoiding macroing entirely.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/header.jpg?t=1589537110,https://discord.gg/CVDFAv4,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,25,0,,Team Teal,Team Teal,"Multi-player,MMO,Steam Achievements,In-App Purchases","Free to Play,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,RPG","Massively Multiplayer,Free to Play,RPG,Indie,Pixel Graphics,2D,Economy,MMORPG","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_09ae0a664bd80b26283a7fabf2b0572069068e58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_044c318d309fb5e2bdaf32842f9ee773a36d6627.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_9c4f009fbd63ea54bdccc2ca342e7344c61fd243.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_d333e7c8266d694426319988a7fadbe9df20b1f7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_f4325752b5e755b354f73f6e00cda6f2945ff75c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_b7ea377efb198b58379ba7a4c16f58c7ece6c3ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_6553664497359546092e15afd602e4413ec31e08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_f0eb87b1532976f4c014ab6f9d07ba96ec2f4544.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_2eaa11488ab7f6b93fd69bd82c9b3fc73fd347e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_add4765877132c3a24256663c336106057eca96b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_bf3ed00c288f58eb46c693962e511a9a13a108b1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1259000/ss_7b472d940d552898377e868a017c082d6570786c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589537110",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256782449/movie_max.mp4?t=1587378324

He was very determined to win, in order to fulfill his dreams of finally representing his country for a sport he loves so much. He's prepared and ready, but that doesn’t stop him from being nervous about his upcoming battle. At the suggestion of his friends and classmates, he goes to a shrine that is rumoured to grant any wish or prayer. He pours all the coins from his already full coin bank into the offering box and says his prayer. After praying, he becomes dizzy and nauseous and eventually faints. When he wakes up, he finds himself in an ancient, unfamiliar place. While searching for a way back to his village, he stumbles upon two girl wielding swords chasing after two… foxgirls? He questions his brain at first, but then follows them, only to be caught up in their shenanigans as well. Who are these girls, and are they involved in Takahiro’s arrival to this new world?

1487140,Ochitsubaki,"Dec 17, 2021",13.99,"A fallen camellia is a beheading, every time, every petal falling at once: a severing. OCHITSUBAKI is a game about the impossibility of translating trauma. It is also about two-tailed catboys, gods with cloud hair, and slapfights. ​ TW: CSA, animal death, violence, suicidal ideation ​════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════​ OCHITSUBAKI || 落ち椿 is a visual novel about the impossibility of translating trauma. It is a bilingual JPN/ENG game about translation and how it can run as deeply as the way hypermarginalized people constantly 'translate' their identities and trauma for the understanding of others, no matter how far it is from the source material. It's about recovering from trauma through the genuine compassion and consideration of another person, who manages to See the aftereffects of trauma and are willing to meet that person's unique needs, regardless of if they 'understand' them or not. ════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════ Hanashiro (he/she/they) and their few remaining kin all react differently to the trauma of being immortal and witnessing the apocalypse over and over again in different cycles of reincarnation. Shiragiku is unfazed and cheery and flippant and whimsical and capricious; Shirayuri is nowhere to be found; and Hanashiro? Hanashiro is planning on their death in 10 years, when the camellias fall, if they cannot find a reason to live by then. Hanashiro and Shirayuri have witnessed THE END OF THE WORLD before. But no one believed them. Shiragiku has seen many, many apocalypses, but she has never been hurt by any one after the first. Shiragiku has remembered every single end; Shirayuri has remembered none; and Hanashiro only remembers some. Which? Even he doesn't know. Hanashiro misses speaking her fey mother tongue, but she can't seem to find anyone willing to listen to her, not even her own kind. And then she makes an enemy who just might. Their name is Lun Kochouran. And they might be the first one in a millennium to learn the Amayuri tongue. They also might be the first to kill an immortal. ════*.·:·.☽✧ ✦ ✧☾.·:·.*════ Ochitsubaki is only loosely a visual novel, which is to say it is a story-based game with a strong aesthetic component. Ochitsubaki has a deep, rich tapestry of aesthetics in unifying modern elegance with unique retro anime-inspired character portraits. The original soundtrack derives inspiration from traditional Asian pentatonic scales, particularly but not limited to Japanese ones, that also derive a modern, Genshin's Liyue-type twist that sets it firmly in contemporary times. It has three language options: JPN, ENG, and JPN translation. The ENG/JPN versions are two different renditions of the story, thus requiring a separate JPN translation, emulating what happens when you try to translate something as complex as identity. You can consider that the only real choice you make in the game is which language to play it in, and each language option provides a different 'route,' a similar but very distinctly different iteration of the story. The language modes mimic the powerful loss that happens when stories--when trauma--is translated.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/header.jpg?t=1639786213,https://feyxuan.com,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,0,"This game contains a character who was sexually abused as a child and metaphorical references to that abuse, and it also contains violence",FEYXUAN,FEYXUAN,Single-player,"Indie,RPG","LGBTQ+,Romance,Experimental,Story Rich,Stylized,Hand-drawn,Dark Fantasy,Surreal,Atmospheric,Fantasy,Magic,Dating Sim,Multiple Endings,Choices Matter,Singleplayer,2D,CRPG,RPG,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_10a124a6f808ee1754b7007582e5723d94d065c4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_bcc9e2b8884a63dc9fc46be56d5d62919be37b23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_b51fe7ac2f66db6f811c099ea9241b087cd0d8c6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_27131575951913dbe1adf280d8cecbeff6971f69.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1487140/ss_3053d8973b1778507ecc0039fb3e3e4d2f12f6cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639786213",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256825406/movie_max.mp4?t=1616469926

251990,Long Live The Queen,"Nov 8, 2013",9.99,"Rule the world or die trying! Being a Princess is not an easy job. Being a Queen is even harder. Especially when you're only fourteen years old, and the reason you've inherited the throne is that your royal mother has just met an untimely end. Now power is up for grabs. You may be the official heir, but much of the country's nobility would love to steal the throne for themselves. Aggressive neighbors will take advantage of any weakness to enlarge their borders at your expense. And that's not even mentioning the magical dangers which are lying in wait... Can you survive long enough to reach your coronation? THE QUEEN IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE QUEEN",['English'],"“Each time the protagonist dies, you find yourself coming back with a vengeance, determined to try a new strategy, a different approach to her upbringing. It's borderline addictive. It's also likely to make a monster out of you. By the end of my first successful playthrough, I had summarily butchered everyone who even thought about looking at us funny, forced the princess into a continuous state of docility and lied my way through every social encounter possible. Was it evil? Yes. Was it glorious? Definitely.” “Somehow it never occurred to my princess, whom I’d lovingly crafted into a tense, paranoid warlord, that she shouldn’t empty a box of mysterious mailcandy into her mouth. You would think studying poison and espionage would have saved me from this espionage poison, but instead, a list of other skills, skills I never studied, princess skills, were key to avoiding this fate. I guess that’s the lesson: you can’t build a successful Arya without adding a little Sansa.” PCGamer “If you’re the sort who can sink your teeth into a full afternoon of tabletop strategy, you’ll be happy here. Long Live The Queen is a slow-paced, cozy evening kind of game, good for folks who like numbers and critical thinking. And death.

You play as an immortal amnesiac wizard who must rebuild his spellbook and slay his rival.

Rift Wizard Features: Open ended character advancement with deep synergies and spell interactions Huge library of spells and passive skills to build from Low randomness, high player agency Diverse and varied monster design High difficulty, permadeath, limited resources Crisp 1990s retro RPG aesthetics Rift Wizard is inspired by classics such as Nethack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Brogue, and Tales of Maj'Eyal, but pushes the genre in a more strategic, combat focused direction. In some ways it is closer to a board game than an RPG. There isn't much plot or exploration in Rift Wizard- just epic wizard battles and deep buildcraft from start to finish. I'm creating Rift Wizard because I want to push the boundaries of the genre. I want to build a deep and challenging roguelike worth exploring for a thousand hours or more.

Upgrade and build your roster of available Mechs from over 80 unique parts, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and playstyles. From flamethrowers to mega missile pods, fighter drones to rayguns, determining the right Mech build and leveraging its weaponry is key to conserving your resources and defeating The Swarm. Mech Armada offers deep grid-based, turn-based combat, where there are no perfect solutions to the challenges you face. Understanding your enemy and anticipating their actions, getting to know the limitations of your Mechs while managing your resources and observing the terrain ahead of you will determine your success. At the end of each area, you’ll need to take on The Swarm’s major bosses: they're massive, ugly and ridiculously tough. Are you up to the task? No two runs in Mech Armada are the same. With procedurally generated levels set across a backdrop of varied post-apocalyptic environments, every element in the game is randomly combined and balanced to create a unique, challenging experience. Like all rogue-likes, death in Mech Armada means game over. You’ll need to try again with an entirely new run, with fresh Mechs and all new encounters. Wanting to try new tactics, Mech designs and strategies without risk? Head to the Sandbox, where you can pick any parts you want.

293520,Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn,"May 27, 2015",14.99,"Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn is a first person hunting simulator where you hunt the largest and most dangerous creatures to ever exist – DINOSAURS. This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It’s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs. You’ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure. There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything from 'pea-brained' dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. key Features: Hunt the largest and most ferocious animals known to man – the Dinosaurs! Huge 3D Free-Roaming Open worlds. Beautiful and realistic high definition graphics. A multitude of different Dinosaurs, from Herbivorous (plant eating) to the Carnivorous (meat Eating). Realistic AI – Dinosaurs react to sight, sound and smell, each with their own mannerisms and Behaviors. Explore and hunt in different Eco-systems including jungles, forests, beaches and rolling Hills. Equip camouflage and Cover Scent to even the odds. A variety of weapons and equipment to choose from (from Sniper Rifle to Cross-bow). Map and Radar to locate and track Dinosaurs. Use tranquilizer darts instead of bullets (experience the thrill of the hunt without the killing).

457140,Oxygen Not Included,"Jul 30, 2019",24.99,"In the space-colony simulation game Oxygen Not Included you’ll find that scarcities of oxygen, warmth and sustenance are constant threats to your colony's survival. Guide colonists through the perils of subterranean asteroid living and watch as their population grows until they're not simply surviving, but thriving... Just make sure you don't forget to breathe. Build Extensive Bases and Discover What it Takes to Survive: Everything in your space colony is under your control, from excavation and resource allocation right down to plumbing and power systems. Resources will begin depleting with your first breath, however, so be sure to dig fast if you want to live. It’s Mind Over Matter with Stress Simulations: Keep the psychological impact of survival at bay with fun leisure activities, great accommodations and even better food for your colony. Duplicants each have different and potentially destructive ways of reacting to stress, so be sure to always keep them happy. Whatever the cost. Avoid Boiling with Thermodynamics: Temperature control is a constant concern in space; too cold and you'll freeze, too hot and you'll fry. Keep tabs on ambient environmental temperatures and your colony's heat production to maintain a nice, cozy atmosphere for your colonists. Enhance Efficiency through Complex Gas and Liquid Simulations: Create interlocking pipe systems to swiftly deliver fuel and liquid to critical areas of your base. Plan well and be rewarded as your colony transforms into an imperishable, well-oiled machine. Take Charge with Power Grid Simulations: Choose from a multitude of power sources including coal, hydrogen, natural gas or just plain old elbow grease. Manage power runoff, circuit overloads and meltdowns to keep your colony running smoothly. Always Keep Yourself Breathing: Enter the Oxygen Overlay and watch air moving through your base in real time. Monitor carbon dioxide accumulation and oversee oxygen generation processes to mold your colony into a veritable deep-space oasis. Waste Nothing through Extreme Recycling: Make use of every last resource for a base that truly exemplifies efficiency. Recycle waste into precious fuel, process unbreathable gas into air or harness the natural bodily processes of wild creatures for food. If you’re clever, you might even be able to run a base off colonist farts. Explore Diverse, Procedurally Generated New Worlds: Summon new worlds with a push of a button.

619150,while True: learn(),"Jan 17, 2019",12.99,"while True: learn() is a puzzle/simulation game about even more puzzling stuff: machine learning, neural networks, big data and AI. But most importantly, it’s about understanding your cat. In this game, you play as a coder who accidentally found out that their cat is extremely good at coding, but not as good at speaking human language. Now this coder (it’s you!) must learn all there is to know about machine learning and use visual programming to build a cat-to-human speech recognition system. This game fits best for... - People who want to know more about how machine learning and related technologies work - Parents and teachers who are looking for a fun and easy way to make an intro to logical thinking, programming, and technologies for kids - Programmers who want to learn new concepts that they can apply to their own coding - Those who want to play games and not feel guilty about ‘wasting their time’ (although we believe you shouldn’t feel guilty at all while playing games!) - Players who like to keep their brains busy and working in different ways, while still having fun - Gamers looking to improve their problem-solving skills and feel immense sense of satisfaction and achievement that comes along with it - People who like smart cats Learn how machine learning works in real life! The game is loosely based on real-life machine learning technologies: from goofy Expert Systems to mighty Recurrent Neural Networks, capable of predicting the future. Don’t worry: it all plays out as a puzzle game. No coding experience required! Train yourself into a data science wizard! Drag objects around your screen with a mouse! Connect them with lines (oh yeah)! Try. Fail. Optimize. Try again. Then press “Release” button and see that sweet pieces of data flow smoothly through your screen. Embrace an adventurous lifestyle of a machine learning specialist! Designing a groundbreaking technology requires time, experience and money. That means you’ll have to work as a freelancer, with all the excitement that comes along with it. Receive emails! Accept contracts! Sit alone in a dark room for days without saying a single word! Socialize on forums! That’s what real data scientists do! Coding just got real! Our quests are based on actual problems, solved by machine learning. This includes building a self-driving car (with your cat as a pilot). And if you really want to test your programming might, you can become a CTO of a startup: it’s your skills and your schemes against the savage laws of the market! Earn a fortune, flip off your bosses and become a tech guru… Or lose everything and crawl back to the doorstep of HR department: at least it was worth trying, right? Improve your gear, improve your life! Once you ensure a stable cashflow, you’ll be able to buy yourself a bunch of fancy hardware to improve your performance. But it’s not just about the hardware! Buy yourself a new smartphone or a geeky figurine! Buy fancy outfits for your cat! Hell, you can even buy yourself an aloe! Fun fact: this is what machine learning specialists actually do.

In the 24th century, humanity comes to be dominated by 3 interstellar mega-corporations after a galaxy-wide economic collapse. Humanity had enjoyed a golden age for over 250 years, where things like war, disease, and poverty were considered a relic of the past. The galaxy is now divided into major regions, the industrialized core systems controlled by the mega-corporations, and thousands of small colonies that make up the frontier. The mega-corporations use mass consumerism to keep the core systems population in check, which requires a continuous flow of resources from the frontier, which in turn creates a conflict between the corporations and colonies over the resources on the colony's planet. Amidst the chaos on the frontier, pirate factions have arisen around organized crime, black markets, and raiding resources.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/header.jpg?t=1658438658,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,Michael Shoots,Michael Shoots,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support","Indie,Simulation,Early Access","Mechs,Simulation,Shooter,Sci-fi,Tactical,Management,Futuristic,Early Access,Singleplayer,Resource Management,Arcade,FPS,First-Person,Third Person,Moddable,Atmospheric,Post-apocalyptic,Indie,Space,3D","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_207e8a51cd43f6cd7b4f2cff5d7db33ef92c565a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_1ce51f21f9ad3b3db54f6795c2e2be01e200b9b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_cc15ab634c94fc21b599596de78baab46c05eecc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_0ff992a6271d87f887eb57430474d163983f81d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_cbc36f02c40a8ea41f368450591f6f8371d02cf8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_110c7fbb7c38087f61f8460a133307c1f7f572ee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_fa08d66c5de63132b26761e6f6cd54a6f7bfe701.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/984610/ss_502bd1c7670cf9ccc00fe6dbd55e1f76c8b6ac17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658438658",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256756791/movie_max.mp4?t=1564670372

378360,Ymir,"Mar 16, 2019",34.99,"Ymir is a 4X multiplayer strategy game combined with a city builder where each player develops a civilization of Pigmen starting at the stone age. The game is divided in 2 main interfaces : a worldmap view and a regional view. Each world tile matches a unique procedurally generated isometric zone that can be explored, settled and built on by players. In each one players can find random resources such as ores , animals or plants depending on the climate, relief and vegetation of the region. Features Pigs with clothes. Multiplayer on local or persistent servers. Complex socio-economic simulator for a challenging city-building experience on its own. Technological evolution with hundreds to techs, from the stone age to post-iron age. Fully procedural worlds where each region is random and unique. 7 biomes, each one with its own specific resources to encourage player-trading. Advanced diplomatic and economic tools to setup treaties ( right of passage, taxes, payments, trade agreements... ) and trade routes between players. Real-time battles. WILL remain free of any pay-to-win . Economy No direct control over population and economy: They breed, age, work and buy things according to the simulation. Population divided in social classes with specific incomes, purchasing power and revenues. Dynamic resources prices based on supply/demand, rarity and production costs. Even player consumed resources are taken into account: materials for buildings have to be bough at their market prices, generating incomes to the producers and affecting the economy. A simulator instead of a set of independent game rules : all variables and actions influence each other in sometimes unpredictable ways that makes things frustratingly challenging. Producing too much of something can be as damaging as not enough making the logic of the game quite different from classic management games. ( ex: instead of having positive effects, distributing a new resource can actually destabilize your economy if you're not careful ) Military Real-time battles are not instantiated and actually take place in your cities. Build and customize your fortifications with walls, bridges, gates, stairs, towers and battlements. With the terrain tools, modify the terrain heights to take maximum advantage of natural defenses like cliffs and hill tops. Water forces troops to embark and cross with slow vulnerable rafts: dig canals around your forts, secure your bridges or build a citadel on a river-island with fortified bridges. A Strategic-tool allows players to design their local defensive strategy in each one of their cities in case of attack: creating defensive zones, setting troops initial deployment positions and setting their behavior in battle. Battles are not instantaneous and belligerents can send reinforcements while a battle is still in progress. Battles can include unlimited 'teams' at the same time, each one fighting according to its allegiances. Battle troops during a battle are all AI controlled ( so that battles can happen independently of the player's presence ). Dozens of unit types including mounted camels, elephants and armored mammoths. Main game modes Real-time mode : a 'classical' mode to be played alone or with a few friends, meant to be played with the permanent presence of all players and to be stopped/continued over several playing sessions. Persistent mode : a more 'MMO' mode where the game server is to be left running 24/7 at all times even when players are offline and where actions take much more time than in the real-time mode. Meant to be played with the maximum number of players on a day-to-day basis, with games lasting several weeks. IMPORTANT This game is a one-man project: development is slow. This game is likely to forever remain an experimental work-in-progress and to never reach the quality, stability and optimization of a finished product: buy it only if you think it's worth it NOW, and not based on future expectations. Playing solo is possible, but the main focus of this game is multiplayer. The game is available in more languages than English, but localization is done by the community and might be partial and incomplete.","['English', 'French']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/header.jpg?t=1576782152,http://ymir-online.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,1,699,,Thibaud Michaud,Thibaud Michaud,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP","Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","City Builder,Colony Sim,Strategy,Multiplayer,Simulation,Economy,4X,Indie,Building,Early Access,Grand Strategy,Alternate History,Historical,Management,Massively Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_22da41290897961174061cdc57f26ad7fb6bf757.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_d8c014cdd1ce3f04be51970d385f8db509a8128e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_f5880dd326249efa9324fe79a4f33ebfcd5e45b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_758f3e1416a884902843251d49b0dc6def59af0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_7a1aeda33713a33426abaaebfe7dad4f6f936063.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_38380234469d636ab5353319c3a18231f81dda9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_6f533aaf3173b8ca6c44e6d22c694632177a58c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_4ce9d8f810296238bb05ce408e162e479250ab18.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_ae7a71a141adf672d7c358e410d5d99b848c22d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_148138b946974a4b0d86f3a619b6b01f1159d2a7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_177b14440b201e4f99ab621dd6cd22ddfc17b24a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_bc6b10f6a81c8906ae40efba0b94136e3d891f43.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_824d7038fc7dcb9c20cb3d4c3b7ad8375ea84207.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_d947e7a95999be0ce04d5318fe545932ca919f61.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_308702bdbf8161d09793e20d27cc6922e1269db4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_14f56a26f3c36ddab7901e170744599cd96e5882.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_0e637330160c80683c9588f4a7ffc6b679388487.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_5d644b7e58eff0570a31319cffb0910dce7f5cb0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_9309eed30297e65e32979c8693453e9eda1707aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/378360/ss_6887356bd76abf941a1e74798dd07d303a7ebd33.1920x1080.jpg?t=1576782152","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256743714/movie_max.mp4?t=1550859206,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256689157/movie_max.mp4?t=1552234573"

Players acting for the 3 of the world superpowers - Britain, Tianxia and the Holy Roman Empires have teams of up to 8 units equipped with guns and machinery of the times of WWI in order to complete 30 tactical missions. For instance, you can be asked to capture an area, defend a lodgement or a person, attempt to sabotage, etc. To succeed in the game, players must: Equip their teams according to the chosen strategy - select the right units, ammunition and armory for the mission; Read mission tactical maps; Lead units in the smart way and accurately - they are so easily killed and you have only few of them; Key Features Realisticity and complexity - actions in the game are driven by solid physic based combat mechanics and this is what it makes to be similar to the classics of table games - Warhammer, Infinity the Game; Possibility to use its own and take over enemy equipment - tanks, cannons and mortars; Possibility to equip units according to the tasks of the missions and your preferences; Original weaponry that is similar to the one used during the times of Great War; Battlecam with a depth of field effect and nice color correction, that gives an old film feeling; Beautiful settings as if drawn by Miyazaki himself; Nice little perks like - destroyable environment, interactive fauna and melee weapons; We sincerely want you to enjoy Steam Squad as we tried hard to make it interesting.

485980,Syrian Warfare,"Feb 21, 2017",13.99,"This war has been going on for a long time, and it's hard to say when it will be over. We got so used to it that news from Syria has become trivial. We've even already forgotten how it all started, and where the roots of the terrible terror lie – the terror that swept across Europe in recent years. Syria is all over the news, and it's become a subject of many documentaries. We, however, want to show the story through the lens of the game and don't let the word 'game' mislead you. This game does not claim to be a history lesson, but it shows the course of the war in all its seriousness through the major milestones, from the first days till the latest important victories over terror. What kind of a game is it? Syrian Warfare is a real time strategy with a high degree of realism. This game is not about a base construction or units production. The player will have to determine their forces characteristics before they go into action. And during the mission, they would be able to select reinforcements in order to support the troopers. The troops and machinery crews move from mission to mission and gain experience, which helps them increase their effectiveness. Trophies captured by the player on the battlefield can be used throughout the whole campaign. Importantly enough, there are no «life bars» for vehicles in the game. Damages are calculated by taking into account the protection module and the power of adverse factors. Inflicted damages affect the functioning of the module. In the battlefield, it is impossible to repair the armor, but one can repair the modules by using a limited stock of spare parts. Ammunition and fuel are also limited. A system of high-quality physical demolition of buildings and other objects is used in the game (it does not only look spectacular, but it has a serious influence on the tactics during the missions, especially in urban areas). The game has a wide set of tactical possibilities: The storming of buildings, usage of smokescreens, infantry lift by helicopters and APC/IFV, air strike calls, capturing of trophy weapons and equipment, usage of heat flares and active defense complexes. And of course the story itself. We will try to show the conflict, not from a point of view of a general, located somewhere at the ‘top’. No, it will be a story of a man, who lived in the country that descended into hell. A story of struggle, loss and regained hope.","['English', 'Russian', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese']","“Качественная реалистичная RTS, практически не имеющая современных аналогов и конкурентов и способная растопить сердце самого либерального любителя стратегий.

1807610,Skeleton Scramble Deluxe,"Mar 18, 2022",2.99,"Skeleton Scramble Deluxe is a fast-paced, head-to-head real-time strategy game, with a focus on local multiplayer. You will take on the role of a necromancer, gathering resources to summon an army of skeletons and frantically building a gauntlet of defenses to fend off your opponent, (or a computer-controlled bot.) An innovative upgrade system lets you build units on top of one another to create new creatures and buildings, adding strategic depth without adding complexity to the controls. Controls are simple and easy to learn, allowing new players to jump right into the action! Play one-handed using only the mouse, connect multiple controllers, or play head-to-head with a friend using a shared keyboard! Your army will move and attack autonomously, allowing you to focus on what to build, and when/where to build it. Most games last under 5 minutes, allowing you to experiment with bold new strategies, or rotate between players in group settings. Maps can be generated randomly, allowing for a more chaotic experience.

1953220,Gem Tower Defense 2,"Apr 21, 2022",2.99,"1. Introduction: Gem tower defense is different from general tower defense games. The map of gem tower defense is extremely open and free. Players need to constantly plan and build labyrinths to delay the advance of waves of monsters hitting the fortress. Well-planned firepower is also essential. Rely on the powerful attack ability of different gem combinations to destroy the monsters who 'please enter the urn' and successfully defend your fortress. 2. Basic gameplay operation: Challenge several waves of invaders, with increasing blood volume and increasing difficulty. 1. Place 5 random gems in each wave, choose one of them to stay after the placement is over, the other gems will be turned into stones, which can be used as a maze. 2. If 2 of the 5 gems placed are the same, you can upgrade a gem with a higher level, and if there are 4 identical gems, you can upgrade a gem with a higher level of 2. 3. If any of the 5 gems placed this time directly meet the special synthesis, click any of the gems to perform the special synthesis. 4. After the placement is over, if there are gems on the map that meet the special synthesis requirements, click any of the gems to perform special synthesis. 5. After the placement is over, select the reserved gems to perform downgrade operations to facilitate the synthesis of special gems. 6. Press the space bar to quickly place and retain. Third, the type attribute of the tower: 1. Basic tower: It is the tower that can appear in each round, divided into eight types and six levels 2. Synthesis tower: a tower that can only be synthesized by formula 3. Stone slabs: Towers that can only be synthesized through recipes (can only be placed and synthesized this time) 4. Star tower: obtained by super-synthesis of the same gems after reservation (the highest three-star, cannot participate in the synthesis) 5. Evolution Tower: The synthesized gems evolve by consuming gold coins (with the highest level and more than one line evolution) 4、 Promotional activities Four, Promotional activities: Steam new users can get 1000 diamond gift packs and send emails to: rangergame@163.com , you can receive the reply of the newcomer's gift bag code.

1128520,Rezist: Tower Defense,"Sep 26, 2019",0.99,"Welcome to the virtual world. There is some valuable data stored on your server. Your task is to protect this data from malicious programs which will try to steal it. Some of them will try to use brute force their way through your defenses. Most, however, will use more sophisticated algorithms. Some of them can be quick, others are well aware of your defenses and will therefore avoid attacks, and some more still you will not notice at all. And remember that it is not only you who can patch your system — your enemies are not standing still, too. Their creators are constantly studying your security utility programs and release more advanced versions. A deep and hardcore tower defense gameplay. A variety of enemies. A giant skills tree. Patches for the Patches God! (And all of them are really useful :) ) An unusual visual style. Every level has its own unique dressing which not only looks good but also moves in tune with the soundtrack. Hotkeys. Camera control: arrows or w, a, s, d. Pause: p. How to play. Your system is targeted by malicious programs. Every one of these programs aims at stealing data from your storage. Your task is to not let them do that. For this, you have: 1. Towers. Three left icons in the level menu. There are 3 types of towers: Red, Green, Blue. A tower of a specific type can only be built on a tile of the same color. The only exception are 'high tiles'. On a tile of this type you can build a tower of any type (this is why such tiles are of a special color). Also, a tower build on such a tile gets an attack range bonus. To build towers, you spend Memory. For each shot, you get experience. When a tower gets enough experience to upgrade, an 'Up' icon appears above it. If you click a tower, you will see a menu which will show: current level, current experience, characteristics (damage, attack range, fire rate), the tower's 'abilities', available upgrades (if there is enough experience). Do not forget to upgrade your towers and look into what new abilities each of the available upgrades gives. This is your way to success because there are particularly strong tower types out there. 2. Special abilities. Three right icons in the level menu. To use abilities, you spend Energy. 1. Hack. This ability has two uses: the first one is hacking something, and the second one is formatting disk space. * Hacking: on many levels, you will see objects surrounded by shields. If you click on such an object, the Hack ability icon will appear above it. If you have enough Energy to use the ability, clicking on this icon will cause one shield to disappear. When an object has no shields covering it, the objects becomes 'Hacked'. From now on, it starts to provide some kind of benefit to the player. * Formatting disk space: every level has areas where you cannot build your towers. This is 'unformatted sick space'. These areas look like a group of chaotically placed cubes of a specific color (Red, Green, Blue). If you use the Hack ability to a tile of this type, the area will be formatted and you will be able to build on it. This might be useful to occupy strategically important points and thus build a more reliable defense. 2. Laser Rain. Allows you to do damage to enemies located in the chosen area. 3. Overclocking. Gives a temporary bonus to attack speeds of all the towers on the level. After every defense attempt (depending on how many waves you have managed to fight off) you get experience and new levels. With each new level, you get 3 patch points. These points can be spent in the patch menu to upgrade your system's defense mechanisms.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/header.jpg?t=1589792761,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,SparkGames,SparkGames,Single-player,"Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_4be639c00f5f0aebe2af86ee8c5b45f6a8f674a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_016c6384567bc24e253133bcb075416e92c69ea4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_2d1b02e13cf6056b6413f82346bdedc6263ab9d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_e587cf3a36df2bbbfcec630d44921ad0ba3f4bbf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_c5d0e1447b631236160fe332bbecb23b2b91fed2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_52dc9d15a04744562d88298b5e9eec9caec62f34.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1128520/ss_717b8e12f40a7cb4b4e9613b19d4f15aa60fddb9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1589792761",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760113/movie_max.mp4?t=1567602189

453130,Powargrid,"Oct 5, 2016",9.99,"Turn based strategy. Explosions. A diverse cast of gelatinous characters. Powargrid is a turn-based strategy game that plays like a board game... with explosions! Destroy your opponent's power plants and protect your own. Strike a balance between attacking, defending, and building your economy to control the board. Blast your opponent with shockwave towers or strike them from afar with the lightning cannon. Construct additional power plants to boost your power economy and extend your reach with substations. Is the situation looking exceedingly grim? Overcharge your power plants for a last ditch defense or a surprise attack! Serious strategy in a light-hearted setting Plan your moves carefully: as with any turn-based strategy game, make tactical decisions and work with the outcome Your leader knows best: Commander Grak knows it all and is not shy to share his thoughts. Hear him out, or dismiss him straight away and focus on the action Challenge all: demonstrate your skills in the campaign mode, multiplayer (online/hotseat/local) and skirmish battles Tinker with the AI: an API is provided that allows you to program the most fearsome opponents possible Achieve the impossible: we dare you to do the (almost) unachievable and collect a range of precious achievements In the story driven campaign, you will take on rival factions as a recruit in the Blue Blobbie army. Get shouted at by your lovable Commander Grak, face down Hero Archeologist Ford of the Red Blobbies, take on the mad green Zealot Zomg, and thwart the schemes of Chairman Swap of the Grand Yellow Blobbie Corporation. And rumors say that's not all... Powargrid also features online and hotseat multiplayer, and skirmish battles against computer opponents.

1564660,Bongo Arena,"Mar 15, 2021",0,"This is a turn-based strategy game with a twist on the traditional gameplay. The twist is, instead of directly controlling the characters IN THE BATTLE, you will be designing the strategies BEFORE THE BATTLE. When the battle begins, your units will follow exactly the strategy you defined, and all you can do then is just watching. Different challenges are presented in different levels. One strategy won't be able to defeat them all. You'll need to learn, adapt then conquer. Developer Note: This is my first game on Steam and I did this by myself. I wanted to avoid popular genres and do something different. Since this type of gameplay isn't popular, the game experience might be somewhat clunky.

1527140,SC2KRender,"Feb 5, 2021",0,"What is SC2KRender? SC2KRender is an open-source program that loads SimCity 2000™ map files (*.sc2) and renders them in 3D. Over 180 unique models were reimagined so you can explore your metropolis like never before. Transforming the 2D world into 3D has limitations and things that just aren't feasible. These design limitations have been solved by studying 3D Maxis games of the early 90s which made use of the SC2 map file format. Please note this program is not endorsed, sponsored, or otherwise affiliated with Maxis or Electronic Arts and all assets (code and graphics) are original works. What game engine are you using? SC2KRender is an open-source project written using DirectX 11 and C++17, it does not use a game engine. A stripped-down version of DirectX ToolKit was used, which is a collection of helper classes and functions for DirectX. Some features of this homebrew include multisampling anti-aliasing, frustum culling, and Direct2D/DirectWrite integration for text rendering. How can I create my own maps? You will need to legally obtain a copy of SCURK or WinSCURK to create maps, or purchase SimCity 2000™ and either load in your saved map or use the included copy of SCURK which comes with it. The Team: Aleksander Krimsky: Programming and Art Thomas Nelson: Lead Artist Various people who have helped along the way are included in the source files available on GitHub. Accomplished Decompress and parse map data Render water, terrain, and building data Fullscreen, borderless, and windowed mode Steam release Future Plans Textures for terrain and models Lighting with day and night modes Render underground data (tunnels, pipes) Link power lines Tentative/Stretch Goals Simulation with cars, boats, planes, etc. Support for AR/VR Help Section Why do objects 'flicker' for me? This can be due to MSAA struggling with some geometries on buildings that use triangular faces, try turning off MSAA to see if the issue is fixed. I will be looking into finding a more permanent fix in the future. Why do objects still 'flicker' for me? This could be due to z-fighting if your camera is very far away from the scene. Try zooming into the scene and see if the issue is resolved. The problem may take a bit more effort to try and resolve. Why is this thing so damn laggy? The map size is 128 * 128 = 16384 possible models, not counting 'scenery' objects. Frustum culling is a feature that prevents rendering objects that are not within your camera, so try going more to the ground-level of a city for better fps. Unfortunately the pipeline for graphics rendering is largely single threaded with the exception of 'command lists' which is an NVidia only-feature. What are you going to do about the performance? The current goal is to work on a technique known as instancing, that should help performance a lot.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1527140/header.jpg?t=1612554217,https://github.com/alekasm/SC2KRender,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,Aleksander Krimsky,Aleksander Krimsky,,"Indie,Utilities","Indie,Utilities,City Builder","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1527140/ss_b74e746654dbc47690cddbef5adb2e872afe9628.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612554217,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1527140/ss_d64f4db3abffc3f2adab7754547a823ce47dbc21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612554217,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1527140/ss_2b965b991ab033e78bf4f55ebe7b607e7291826b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612554217,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1527140/ss_57f18a1f840b2c14d5c369804ee95c1c8207f8e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612554217,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1527140/ss_066698b6c22602809305cc62e257a514edf093ca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1612554217",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256818537/movie_max.mp4?t=1611068170

3010,Xpand Rally,"Aug 24, 2006",4.99,"Xpand Rally is a breathtaking game that gives you the true to life experience of driving powerful rally cars amidst photorealistic sceneries. Realistic weather effects, rolling hills, and animated scenery all add to game's visual perfection. Xpand Rally also features highly detailed models of modern rally cars and handling physics developed with the help of rally sport professionals which further enhance the realism of driving experience. Xpand Rally combines the best elements of Rally and Rally Cross racing in one unique gaming experience. The game offers a career mode based on time trials during both individual races and World Championship Series which will satisfy traditional Rally fans. The Rally Cross fans won't be disappointed either - they can challenge several opponents in head to head racing during competitions based on real and fictitious race events. Xpand Rally, as the only title on the market, brings the economy factor into a rally game. The player starts with a junk car and competes in races to earn money and acquire upgrades, repair damage, tweak performance and pay the race entry fees. Along with the tuning-up, the car's condition affects its handling. Due to accurate damage system, it is highly dependent on the player's driving skills. The physical handling model is also influenced by car parts configuration and provides both authentic feel and joy of driving. The interactive race track surroundings with enhanced game physics and the innovative approach to changing daytime and weather conditions, both influencing the car handling, are other hallmarks of Xpand Rally that distinguish it from other racing games. For the first time among rally games Xpand Rally includes a complete set of easy-to-use editing tools enabling to create new tracks, cars or even game mods.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/header.jpg?t=1639506578,http://www.xpandrally.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,311,,Techland,Techland,"Single-player,Multi-player",Racing,"Racing,Driving,Automobile Sim,Physics,3D,Economy,Multiplayer,Singleplayer,Offroad","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000484.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000483.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000485.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000481.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000000482.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001253.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001254.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/3010/0000001255.1920x1080.jpg?t=1639506578",

But as the stakes are risen and new challenges are presented, how will the motivations of those around her change?

One day, you decide you want to be the star of new RPG series. So the game begins... You are on the lookout for fun and adventure. But as the story unfolds, something is terribly wrong with the very game you are playing. Unravel the mystery. Beat the game! On your journey you will meet many NPC's. Some have interesting things to say and some of them will even join you on your quest. There is turnbased combat, leveling, gearing-up, worldmap, ect... All the classic components an old-school RPG should have. There is also a big deal of humor, slightly sexual conversations and secrets to encounter! Instead of 'potions', 'Elexirs', 'Phoenix-Downs', ... You have 'Beer', 'Whiskey', 'Wine', ... Soooo... Are you still reading this?! GREAT! That means you are awesome! (Or have a lot of spare time...)

974930,Eternal Realm II: Dark Matter,"Nov 21, 2018",3.99,"The Eternal Realm was created a millenium ago by the king Zerberus. It is a world filled with Dark Matter, a substance that grants immortality and the ability to create virtual worlds. However, living in such a dark world can make one insane. The king and his creations have lived in this peaceful yet, disturbing world for ages but, those times are about to come to an end. The 'Realm Breaker' is about to shatter everyone's perspective of what 'reality' really is. Archimedes, a member of the 'Royal Seed' has embarked on creating a new world with characters using life-like A.I. The player characters he created are now the rulers of this world, but, in name only. Almost as soon as Archimedes gives them the kingdom, a strange abyss phenomena starts appearing all over the land. The ten heroes set out to save their world against this new threat. Meanwhile, in the Eternal Realm, Archimedes' project is sabotaged and now he and his friends are branded as traitors. Who is this unknown enemy lurking in the shadows? Why is he framing Archimedes? This game is part II of the 'Royal War Saga'. Part I of the game was a satire of the jrpg genre. Playing this game is helpful but not necessary to understand the story. Eternal Realm II takes on a more serious tone and develops the characters and story a great deal more. Important Characters: Warrior : Arrogant and self-proclaimed king of the realm Berserker : Stupid, naive, and friendly. Good at killing things with his ax. Sentine l: Always calm. Never says anything. Defender : Chivalrous and valiant. He always talks in capital letters. Hunter : Usually normal but, has multiple personalities Rogue : Lazy and sneaky. Just likes to chill. Ice Mage : Cowardly and shy. Flame Mage : Lunatic. Randomly says morbid things and like to burn things with his flames. Thunder Mage : Typical air-headed girl. Earth Mage : Scholarly individual that likes to use big words. Most find him boring. Archimedes : Creator of the guild; he has been branded a traitor by the king because of the 'Realm Breaker' incident. Balthasar, Chronos, Dinah : Archimedes' friends that assisted him in activating Realm Breaker. Eldrick, Nara, Merlock : Members of the Royal Seed sent out to capture Archimedes. Yarin : The eldest of the Royal Seed. He has lived for over 900 years. King Zerberus : King and creator of the Eternal Realm. He has ruled over this world for over 1000 years. Features: 2 difficulty modes (Normal and Easy) Free-Turn Stamina Battle System (mixture of SMT Nocturne and Chrono Cross) 10 playable characters Over 90 different enemy types Several optional mini-bosses Non-random encounters Full recovery after every battle Save anywhere 2 different endings The Free-turn Stamina battle system allows you to take 4 actions per turn. The actions can be divided up between the characters as you see fit as long as they have the stamina to carry out the action. Characters recover 30-40% of their stamina per turn and the 'Rest' command allows an extra 40% to be recovered. It's the same battle system from Eternal Realm but, now with more options, diversity of abilities, and a more balanced difficulty level.

748490,The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel II,"Feb 14, 2018",39.99,"Peace is but a memory. In the wake of the Noble Faction’s occupation of Heimdallr, civil war has broken out across Erebonia. The provincial armies, loyal to the aristocracy and the Four Great Houses, have claimed many of the nation’s great cities in the name of the Noble Alliance. The Imperial Army, called back from the four corners of the Empire, has only just begun its sweeping counterattack. After Rean managed to escape Trista with Celine and Valimar, he awakens in the mountains near his hometown uncertain what fate befell his friends, who bravely threw themselves in harm’s way to buy him time to flee. Though the road will not be an easy one, Rean decides to take up his sword again, journeying across Erebonia with his Divine Knight, Valimar, in search of his friends from Class VII and a way to end the conflict before its price becomes far too dear… ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Taking place on the same continent as the fan favorite Trails in the Sky offshoot of Nihon Falcom’s storied The Legend of Heroes franchise, Trails of Cold Steel II (Sen no Kiseki II in Japanese) is a direct sequel to Trails of Cold Steel, picking up one month after the decisive collision that changed the fate of the entire nation of Erebonia. The speedy, tactical turn-based combat with the newly-developed “ARCUS” system returns with all the bells and whistles together with the new Overdrive mode, new means of transportation both across the land and sky, new allies, new dangers, and a renewed sense of hope as Rean tirelessly works to right the wrongs that have led the country to disarray. KEY FEATURES A Direct Sequel that Remembers the Past Clear data from Trails of Cold Steel carries over into Trails of Cold Steel II, granting players bonuses, and most importantly, remembering the many relationships cultivated during time spent at Thors Military Academy, allowing for more personalized conversations throughout the story. Take to the Land and Sky in New Modes of Transportation Fast travel isn’t just for Trista anymore; a personalized airship now allows players to swiftly choose and descend upon both familiar and foreign destinations alike—and on land, horseback riding not only returns, but players can now customize and utilize Angelica’s orbal bike for fast transportation across the map. The Link System Returns with a new Overdrive Mode Bonding with allies continues to pay off with the Combat Link System, netting a variety of combat benefits including healing, guarding, and more, and the new Overdrive mode allows linked characters to attack up to three turns in a row for new strategic battle options. Experience the Game as Never Before 50% more lines of English voice-overs have been added to the PC release, bringing a fresh experience to even those who have played it before on console.

E.g. a cave wall next to a rocky ground will automatically create a jagged wall, but the same cave wall next to a marble floor would create a much smoother wall because this is likely to be an indoor room with polished walls. About 50 different terrain types to choose from Icons included for the most common objects, e.g. doors, stairs, tables, beds, trees, bushes, pentagrams Color maps or old school black and white style Adjacent terrains interact automatically to create jagged edges, smooth transitions and shadows when necessary Random fractals used to create shapes for cave walls, rivers and other non regular terrains Create a multi-page pdf with the dungeon divided into pages suitable for printing Export dungeon as a single png suitable for Foundry VTT, Roll20, Fantasy Grounds and similar applications Export wall data that can be used for dynamic lightning in Foundry VTT or Roll20 (requires roll20 pro subscription) Configurable square and paper sizes, (default is 1 inch squares on A4 pages) Outdoor and dungeon shadows with configurable strength Export to your favorite paint program for finishing touches Import your own icons Create new terrain types from imported images Configurable grid, default is to not draw it on top of walls and with thicker lines between pages Grid based, terrain is placed in squares or on square edges (icons can be placed and rotated freely) Shortcuts to quickly put a random door, tree or bush in a square Dungeon layout can be imported from a simple ASCII text file, like this Create random dungeons automatically Editor to create rules for your own random dungeon Color dungeons can be converted to Black &amp; White style dungeons automatically Export with a 3d look Steam workshop support",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/header.jpg?t=1648049497,http://www.illwinter.com/floorplan,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,0,384,,Illwinter Game Design,Illwinter Game Design,Steam Workshop,"RPG,Design & Illustration,Utilities","Design & Illustration,RPG,Utilities,Software","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_d3671c8562e8b8c1fcb9fd3af14ad2df4a4594e0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_a3c03579b273c27dfa8ec07a05e3491568b2e4e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_c05527508f294cf79590a187b702f75316d96dee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_14af3e7235050a557c2c16e56ab680719952d5e5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_aaa501cfd06e98f05b2547b418986c1d19b2872a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_a3b8ea5e84a9c781980f67646a731e9c08a15b72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_7af1a3027a4ff21ee35bb151b0142522ad1e3a44.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_bfb6bc5dbe2d33c851d072816d4d68735a6e205c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_80d4fa28d8975eed9b2d176a569137d19fa22936.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_09967a891ac654bfed9c86e8955bc812add62123.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_250c0522399019c3497271bed4f80b8c92815d22.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_9c0d76e3ce261c627eaf5f129c42e70aeb790ca6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_4c77fbc1f14c6ff47e5698c9cfe3cd1462cfb3ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_a3e6b66291e672704568a168df78c2055cd4f94f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_72d0a12be34f837f4fad3831362e0881014aa916.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_609cdc8b2a7c0c2d6815221745fe7319c48375b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_47691f57dd37d95afa6d3b32ea1cd024530653ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_72274e32b1615ec842685a01e570b4f258c565d2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/630900/ss_449a81adc6b86d5c65f79ae1aba14442076892cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648049497",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256713923/movie_max.mp4?t=1523394609

Compete against other Draoi, practice your skills and earn both respect and fear. In our world, you can: Cast spells by carving them in the air with your bare hands. Spells are more powerful for the Draoi that can cast them with the precision and flair of only the mightiest practitioners. If you were born to do this, your enemies will know it.

Talk to those around you or coordinate with your team as you explore and battle.

Animations and particle effects, tokens, and audio files can be used to immerse your players. It's a player, not a 3d map-building software. Both the demo and the full version contain only a few simple battle grids, so you will need the videos or static battle maps of Dynamic Dungeons or other creators. This software is in constant development, future updates will be free. Import Dynamic Dungeons maps or your own images or video files into the storyline and make a playlist, cover and reveal areas with the fog of war tool, apply custom size hex or quad grid overlay. Playing on the Tv screen is easier than you think. Simply lay flat your TV. You can protect the screen with a cheap plexiglass sheet, and use dry or wet-erase markers on it, so miniatures and dice rolls won't damage the surface of the Tv. You can also project down the video onto a physical table with an HD projector. Please note, that it's not a VTT for online gaming. The Dynamic Dungeons Editor will help you to adjust the color of the videos and static maps, import png tokens to represent the players and their foes. You can play various ambient sounds and use particle effects to pimp up static or animated maps. A free modular dungeon pack is available for this software containing more than 100 png props like corridors and various chambers to build your own dungeon. (Although there are many customization options available and custom 2D maps can be created with the application, be aware that Dynamic Dungeons maps are not made with this app, but in various 3D software. You may want to try the demo version before you buy.)",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/header.jpg?t=1646316909,https://dynamicdungeons.com/,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,0,0,,Dynamic Dungeons,Dynamic Dungeons,"Single-player,Includes level editor","RPG,Early Access","RPG,Software,Utilities,Top-Down,Fantasy,Tabletop,Animation & Modeling,Board Game,Mystery Dungeon,Early Access,Choose Your Own Adventure,Family Friendly,Local Multiplayer,3D,Gaming","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_7a743f9cadebe35de2f11333b35f51a03ccc255d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_1a9a95374b0755e82c15525d9cdd87d6966df574.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_e27c92e30b95d22c2609837983367efa701e8198.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_9deeb8a0f91106334cc3f0791bbd2f3b5d82ca4a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1694430/ss_f483731e6f37dde51629d99d82df840583b6700e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1646316909",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256848447/movie_max.mp4?t=1634111017
1453640,Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story 2,"Mar 31, 2022",11.99,"Valthiria’s mightiest heroes are not born of destiny or prophecy. They were enrolled, trained and taught in special academies. Hero School Story 2 places you in charge of a hero academy to create the next generation of heroes who will save Valthiria from the dark forces that threaten it. Take command of the faculty, nurture a unique and ever-changing roster of students, forge alliances with the kingdoms who vie for influence and earn your place among the most prestigious Hero Schools in Valthiria. Combining the RPG and Simulation genres, in Hero School Story 2 you will manage your students by determining their learning schedules and courses, building their stats and skills to shape them into the heroes you desire. These stats are key when sending your students to fulfill quests from people all over Valthiria, defeating various enemies in strategic turn-based combat and adding to your academy’s renown. Yet there’s no time to rest on laurels – every school year the seniors will graduate and freshmen will enroll, so managing your academy to fit the dynamic roster of students is crucial. Create Your Own Hero Academy As Principal of the academy, your task is to allocate your students what classes and courses to learn, shaping them into the heroes you want them to become. Will you focus on magical courses and become a school of great wizards, one for mighty warriors, or perhaps a bit of everything? Your management style will determine the kind of quests you can take – as enemies are locks to students’ keys, fulfilling harder quests will require build specific rosters to solve these challenges. Plan, Forecast, Execute, Repeat Foresight and strategic turn-by-turn decisions are critical to succeed in our unique turn-based combat system. Built around class-based proficiencies and breaking enemy weaknesses, players are rewarded both for bringing an optimal team composition and taking calculated risks in combat. Whether playing it safe or taking the gung-ho way, it’s up to you how to solve the challenges presented. Manage a Dynamic Student Roster Despite the lure to focus on caring and honing just the best students, as a Principal it is your duty to ensure that every children taken under the wings of your academy thrive. Students will stay for only three years before they must graduate, and every one of them will affect your academy’s reputation (which will deter gifted students to enroll next year!). So manage your whole student roster well, as focusing on just a select few individuals may gimp you when they inevitably leave the school grounds, as you will be left with those less cared for.",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/header.jpg?t=1658216154,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,Agate International,PQube,Single-player,"RPG,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Early Access,RPG,Simulation,Management,Party-Based RPG,3D,Turn-Based Combat,Anime,Colorful,Fantasy,Resource Management,Singleplayer,Strategy,Sequel,Strategy RPG,JRPG,Isometric,Story Rich,Stylized,Fighting","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_5718ba94ad9189c8df4e2db34c8f066935c5a94d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_894583931185be93cd7290a15af36c53e8c628e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_a99efb061af50030fc3b9051da8741f4d1eafcfe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_6d8184c24e07517e6432aa1696faebb98128478a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_b4dd28ee63028651155817383bf71d4bed396da4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_cf366a1296212f58ef278a6baa03e8354a2f43c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_3e6356a638d0b7f23d2ea6e2de74b2b626d99bb4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_6de1aa39b40bd5b700a11f5e7585ef991e47cd9d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_b118d457f24ec35650ba4e168b25463eed12fc78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1453640/ss_9535f88139af8d1e7d5c210ceadcdf82bf911109.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658216154","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256880295/movie_max.mp4?t=1648723667,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256831902/movie_max.mp4?t=1619182931"

A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield. Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play. Try our example 'Custom Camapign' mod to set up new unique campaigns. Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced. Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself. Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass.

To its enormous credit, it avoids all those pitfalls, and makes an interesting game in the process.” A- – Gaming Ages “Mary Skelter is sublime. By turns darkly sensual and horrific, it's also beautiful, ravishing, and backed by truly expert level design and a clean, clever combat system. This game is too different to effectively compare to other dungeon crawlers, but I must say, of all the many games in this genre that I've played, this one will sit with me for a very long time into the future.” 4.5/5 – Digtally Downloaded “Mary Skelter: Nightmares provides the dungeon crawling experience fans of the genre crave. The game offers a unique battle system that requires attention and skill to master, many different ways to customize characters, and large dungeons to explore with many hidden rooms and valuable loot.” 8.5/10 – Dual Shockers",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/header.jpg?t=1572629279,,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,34,429,,Idea Factory,Ghostlight LTD,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Sexual Content,Adventure,RPG,Strategy","JRPG,Dungeon Crawler,Anime,Horror,Visual Novel,Turn-Based,Exploration,Dating Sim,Party-Based RPG,Female Protagonist,RPG,Strategy,First-Person,Story Rich,Lore-Rich,Romance,Turn-Based Combat,Multiple Endings,CRPG,Action","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_fba1e3fe8d22e962228fddd2b763d83a1f7464e2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_c3048127064073cc8a99047f20bfc45d87c91fef.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_87f2347bb6ec4ed5c132da25a8a711b33870d195.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_22f8d0d7f787fc0911064a3ffcedc139adfc0a67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_1f89c95ecbd4e3ecb795bf4b290e0a466d3ea94e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_85846e212e1bb7b042ec0ca686f98f482df9c1ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_f0301961456f9597e48f184ce0284f1d75d944d7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_c789b9a82e4395b1659bcc38f8d34280a19b9665.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_59ce8f5422c6ff1af0a061adf68bab4262fbbc68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_8dc568e1806a9d13a47ecf5d3821ad409f2f4f94.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_df3d4f0a8cfe58b57fa34b5a3b61b982dfe2f7a8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/837610/ss_c2fdc3c51358ee99de0a9f3d398b1ed782d3074c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1572629279",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256722494/movie_max.mp4?t=1531833900

544220,Damage: Sadistic Butchering of Humanity,"Dec 11, 2016",4.2,"THE GAME Damage is a violent but humorous 2D-adventure-shooter based on Amiga cult classic which was originally released in 1996. The idea of Damage is simple: kill as many people as possible! Damage is an adventure game where you can roam freely in a wide urban setting, loot money and goods, buy weapons and other equipment from the black market and kill thousands of enemies: harmless civilians, policemen, army troopers, organised criminals, bloodhounds and vehicles. DSBoH is humoristic and harmless outlet for our violent instincts. THE STORY In Damage you take control of a formerly exemplary man named Michael Modelcitizen, who had everything a man could possibly dream of. Because of that, he soon became deeply frustrated. Michael tried various methods in search of a new super human state, but during the process something went terribly wrong. The solution to regaining his previous status is ugly. Michael starts with a primitive baseball bat, taking out unaware passers-by. It's not long before Michael's actions begins to attract the members of authority - who all try to eliminate him. Of course, he has access to numerous appetising weapons, and he starts experimenting with dangerous drugs to keep himself alive. In Damage, you play as Michael and we guarantee you many, many delightful discoveries and a feeling of extreme freedom to venture and express yourself. LEGACY About Amiga version (1993-1997) The enormous project of making an ideal game of our own started back in 1993. We soon became overly ambitious, and we had no idea of what it took to carry out our plans. But we couldn't give in, just took new challenges to make Damage the best it could be. In 1996 the game was ready and players loved it!",['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/header.jpg?t=1481453954,http://sadisticbutchering.com,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,,Suomi-Peli,Suomi-Peli,Single-player,"Sexual Content,Nudity,Violent,Gore,Action,Adventure,Indie,Early Access","Gore,Nudity,Indie,Sexual Content,Action,Early Access,Violent,Adventure,Dark Humor","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_9db08480c2f425197319f0ca137d7911e5bc63e1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_9608f2a910b64755f6d759f51158238a3c4d5b2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_e271dfa796de9756e345ab9f1b4fc200b1ce99a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_145338cda9be97611bd17d03350ab56b20e694d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/544220/ss_aaf604428ee8743fae6ad84d3ce202accd280efb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1481453954",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256675884/movie_max.mp4?t=1481133083

You’ll set up things like houses and tools, without using hardly any words, just like a simulation game. This becomes an act of programming, and as a result, you’ll be able to develop software. “Programs are toys.” You may wonder what it means to think like a program. Some people might even see the word in English and scream “Ahhhh! English!!! Run awaaay!!” In that case, why not think of it as “playing with building blocks (programing)” instead? The block structure you make runs as software. The only resource you need is this application. I’ll say it once more. “Programs are toys.” Now’s your chance to assemble some toys. This isn’t simply a program (toy). This isn’t simply a game. Through this toy (game), you can develop software. Once you’ve developed something, you can use the attached CARPEXECUTABLE.exe (HANDMADE CARPEXECUTABLE) (It is in the [C:\Program Files (x86)\steam\steamapps\common\HANDMADE CARPROGRAM\CARPROGRAM] folder) to execute your creation, and even distribute it to others.

292180,X-Plane 10 Global - 64 Bit,"Jul 14, 2014",0,"X-Plane 10 Global is the latest version of a simulator that has been in development continuously for almost 20 years. This latest version of X-Plane 10 brings numerous improvements and enhancements for PC, Mac and Linux virtual pilots, unleashing the power of modern systems with its 64 bit processing and multi-core support. Designed to be the most flexible flight simulator it has a fully open structure that allows the enthusiast to change every part. With thousands of compatible add-ons there is no kind of flying craft that is not simulated and there is a whole world to explore. Boasting a 20 year old pedigree, X-Plane utilizes Incredible cloudscapes to bring the sky to life whilst the ground depicts real-world roads, cities, towns and more to ensure the most realistic flying experience possible. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights. The core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop. Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 Global is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Each aircraft flies just as it should, from the glider to the Space Shuttle! Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shut-down and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. It’s still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation! X-Plane 10 Global is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 Global is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down. Features Super accurate flight characteristics using a virtual wind tunnel Includes 30 aircraft, from gliders to the Space Shuttle Online flying with other virtual pilots Air Traffic Control actually controls the other aircraft around you Accurate terrain, roads and more Global ‘Plausible World’ auto generated scenery New rendering engine with innovative global lighting 64 Bit optimized Totally flexible and extendable with thousands of existing add-ons (and many more to come) Includes super-detailed scenery for Nice (LFMN), Paderborn-Lippstadt (EDLP) and Faro (LPFR) printed “Quick Start Guide” included Default Scenery Having installed the software via Steam you only have the main simulator as well as the Seattle region. More scenery has been divided into various free and optional DLCs. Installation of said DLCs is quite simple and is done very fast. -&gt; Guide","['English', 'German', 'French', 'Italian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian']","“I am, however, going to tell you that in my personal and professional opinion, there is no software on the planet that can touch X-Plane 10 for realism, in regards to a simulator you can have at home.

For the safe flight of aircraft, air traffic controllers play a vital role. We focus on the duties of these controllers in our game scenarios.

The operation is quite simple, just select an aircraft and click Instruction buttons. Yet as the situation keeps changing according to the directions issued and the timing, clearing the stage always requires precise and correct judgment. Even after game over, you can resume from the middle of the game replay.

633660,Onimod Land,"Nov 10, 2017",9.99,"Onimod Land is real-time strategy game. The premise of the game centers around a conflict between inhabiting aboriginals and settlers from space as they both try to colonize a planet. The number of units is almost limitless, which makes for gi-normously impressive battles with lot of tanks, helicopters, catapults, etc. Each race has a unique set of skills (technologies or magic spells) with more than 30 upgrades. The AI of the units allows them to help each other during a battle, repair broken buildings, etc. Game networking supports up to 8 players. The game mechanics allow players to declare (or break) political alliances. There are 5 campaigns and 30 maps in the game. With the map editor built into the game, you can just keep adding more maps. Graphics: 2D isometric Screen Resolution: any Technologies of Programming: C++ and Assembly This project began in the late 90's, when games focused on game play with only 8-bit graphics. Games such as 'Warcraft 2' and 'Age of Empires 1' emerged as a sensation because of their clever game play. Beating this game with it's brutal efficiency and crafty knack for making shrewd decisions is quite a challenge. The AI is quite intelligent and even I, as the author, can't win with more than 3 computer opponents. The game AI plays without cheating. It doesn't fudge resources nor spy on the player. I stress tested my server using a few of my friends. It’s possible that efficiency issues may pop up with a larger number of players. Just be aware that I’m entirely aware of this potential problem and will be looking out for it.

1843230,Win by Definition,"Jan 17, 2022",8.99,"Do 'Win'! 'Win by Definition' is a one-player card game adventure. The card games you've been playing are probably that you have to try to reduce the opponent's HP/LP or collect some points to win. Sometimes you may be a bit tired of bogus rules and incomprehensible effect processing. But this game is quite different. Run the card which has the effect 'win' below, or that's all. you will be born as a role of a subspace in a world where nothing should have existed and explore for what you are. The goal [/] In a card game, you do everything that is written on the card. Draw cards, send them to the graveyard area, exile things ... that's not all. You even need a card to enter some stages and move around the world. Sometimes you will get and own cards, for battle others. Define the victory, and challenge every way for the victory. Features [/] Unquestionable gameplay [/] It's very difficult to explain how this game works. If I say 'You use one card. Repeat this.', It may be an explanation of the rules. The most remarkable feature of this game is its simplicity. What to draw each turn, how many cards to draw, where you draw from, even where is the hand, how can you win for, are there opponents, and what are your live points, even is there a status of 'life point' ? Everything is undefined until a stage starts. Example of Card effects [/] Here are just a sort of 5% of the effects used in the game. 「Card A」を1枚手札に加える．(Add 1 'Card A' to your hand.) 手札を100枚捨てる．(Put 100 cards in your hand into the graveyard.) 「ライフポイント」を2にする．(Set your 'life point' to 2.) 墓地が30枚以上なら，勝つ．(If you have 30 or more graveyards, you win.) 「手札の1枚」を手札に加える．(Add one of your 'one of your hand' to your hand. it's not one of your hand but a card named 'one of your hand'.) 「墓地」は「手札」を意味する．('Cemetery' means 'hand'.) 「song.ogg」を再生する．(Play 'song.ogg'.) 背景をギザギザにする． (bold the background with the tile of 'gizagiza (=jagged)'.) 場を非公開情報にする．(Make 'the field' private information that you can't see.)[/] from the developer [/] So, for the first time, my name is Toorun12.

Download and play today to find out why Cthulhu Realms is so crazily addictive! How to Play the Game: In Cthulhu Realms, each player tries to drive their opponent insane or have more sanity than their opponents when the deck runs out. Each player starts the game with a small deck comprised of initiates, goons and followers. Five cards from the deck form a row of available cards on the table; with more than two players, place three available cards between each pair of players. Each turn, you start with five cards in hand, playing those cards in order to put locations into play, boost your own sanity or reduce that of others, collect conjuring power to acquire new cards, and remove cards from the game. You can use the power of your locations once each turn. At the end of your turn, discard any cards still in hand and all entities and artifacts that you played. If you lose all of your sanity, you're out of the game. If you're the only one at the table who's still sane, you win. Otherwise, the game ends when the deck runs out and whoever has the most sanity wins.
